				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was pointed to John Hunter&#8217;s <em><a href="http://nipy.sourceforge.net/nipy/devel/faq/johns_bsd_pitch.html">Why we should be using BSD</a></em> and came to think about how I rather tend to advocate using the GPL license. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman">Richard Stallman </a>makes some very convincing arguments for <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html">why GPL is the better choice</a>, but even though I like this reasoning, I do see why choosing a different license may be the right choice.</p>
<p>In this post, I will explain some of the differences between <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses">BSD</a> and <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GPL</a> and hopefully help you to choose for yourself. The target audience for this post are people in the scientific community, but it may also be useful to others.</p>
<p>So how do BSD and GPL differ? Below I have listed what I think is most important, but please remember that I am not a lawyer, and that there are other effects of licensing that may apply to you:</p>
<ul>
<li>BSD is a free-for-all license that only requires attribution. Anyone using your code must give credit to you as the original author. Apart from that, they can do pretty much everything. They can change the code and sell programs based on it without asking you.</li>
<li>GPL too requires attribution. However, it also requires anyone distributing software based on your source code to make available any changes they make to it. They can still sell programs based on your code to others without asking, but if they were to do something really smart with your code, you can demand that they share the changes with you. And you too can sell software based on their changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before moving on, I would like to clarify one important thing: Even though you are licensing your code as BSD or GPL, you can still sell software based on your code. You can even sell the rights to use your code with a different license. The licenses only apply to what other people can do with your code. You still keep all other rights.</p>
<p>In the below table, I have summarized the differences between the licenses by listing a few scenarios. &#8220;They&#8221; is referring to someone using your code in their own software projects:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td><strong>BSD</strong></td>
<td><strong>GPL</strong></td>

<tr>

<td><span style="color: #800000;">✖</span> *</td>
<td><span style="color: #339966;">✔ </span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><em>*Except if they also use a BSD license for their changes.</em></p>
<p>Some people call GPL &#8220;viral&#8221; because it &#8220;infects&#8221; any software using GPL licensed code. Any project using code with a GPL license will basically have to be GPL licensed too. This may be a showstopper for some companies that want to keep their own changes proprietary (secret/hidden) while still using your code. Note that this only applies if they distribute the software to others: If someone downloads your code and plays around with it on their own computer, they don&#8217;t have to care about the GPL license.</p>
<p>The viral effect is why Richard Stallman advocates the GPL license. He thinks that it benefits the open source community (and perhaps also the scientific community) that software using GPL code must be GPL too. In his opinion, companies have money to spend on developing new products or to buy access to other people&#8217;s source code. The open source community, on the other hand, does not necessarily have the same monetary resources, but has access to all the open source code out there. If an open source project is fine with the adhering to the GPL license, they can also use all other GPL licensed code .</p>
<p>Further, I think you should choose GPL for any code you think might be commercially viable <em>for yourself</em> in the future. Some people think the best option is to keep source code proprietary if you want to make money of it in the future. I think the exact opposite. If you are working on a project that you believe has some commercial value, why not let others find that commercial value for you? If someone starts selling software based on an improved version of your code, you can demand that they share the changes with you and start selling the software yourself.</p>
<p>However, there are many good arguments for using the BSD license too. Many open source projects are working with companies that require code not to be GPL licensed. One such project is <a href="http://matplotlib.org/">Matplotlib</a>, for which John Hunter is the original author. They have received contributions from companies like <a href="http://enthought.com">Enthought</a>, which want to make sure they don&#8217;t have to license all their software as GPL because some code they use is from GPL projects. Such contributions are often significant for open source projects, and I can see why choosing BSD is a good middle way for them to keep the project open while still getting as much benefit from cooperation with companies.</p>
<p>Some also argue that BSD attracts more developers than GPL because some developers may be put off by a GPL license. However, I believe this works both ways. Some developers are also put off by non-GPL projects. I don&#8217;t think your licensing choice will change much in the number of developers that are attracted to your project. If anything, I would do some research and contact relevant companies and developers and ask if they would be willing to contribute to your project. You can always change the license as you go, but you should know that all code that has already been licensed as GPL or BSD will forever be licensed that way. It is non-retractable. Any future changes you make to your own code, however, can be put under a different license. You may even choose not to license your new code any more if you want to.</p>
<p>To conclude, when choosing between BSD and GPL, you should consider whether your main goal is to contribute to the open source community or to everyone in general. If you target only the open source community, GPL may be your best choice. If you want to contribute to everyone without further restrictions to the usage of your code, BSD may be your best bet.</p>
<p>Personally, I will continue using GPL as long as I think my code may turn into a commercially viable project or if I just don&#8217;t have a long-term plan yet. However, I will happily use BSD if I think the code can be contributed into a BSD licensed project such as Matplotlib.</p>
<p>There are also many other licenses out there. Have a look at the list made by the <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses">Open Source Initiative</a> if you want to know more about other licenses.</p>

<p>I would recommend this post for those of you who wonder what neural networks really do (spoiler: it&#8217;s just math) and why the training doesn&#8217;t always work as expected. The post is a bit advanced, but the first few paragraphs should be interesting for those of you who are unfamiliar with neural networks as well.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://neuralensemble.org/sumatra/">Sumatra</a> is a great tool for reproducibility and provenance when you are running numerical simulations. Keeping your work reproducible ensures that you and others will be able to check your results at a later time, while provenance is to keep track of where your results came from in the first place.</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t get into details about using <a href="http://neuralensemble.org/sumatra/">Sumatra</a> in this post, as <a href="http://pythonhosted.org/Sumatra/">its documentation</a> is quite good at describing that already.</p>
<h2>Computational Physics members</h2>
<p>If you are a member of the <a href="http://comp-phys.net/">Computational Physics group</a> and have access to <a href="http://comp-phys.net/cluster-info/">the computing cluster, Smaug</a>, you don&#8217;t have to install anything. Just ssh into our dedicated Sumatra machine, named bender, and run your jobs from there. In the future, all machines will support Sumatra, but for now, we only have one dedicated machine for this task:</p>
<pre>ssh bender</pre>
<h2>On your own machine</h2>
<p>Otherwise, or if you want it on your own machine, you will have to install it manually. This is done by cloning the repository and running the setup.py file. This will install Sumatra with all dependencies:</p>
<pre>hg clone https://bitbucket.org/apdavison/sumatra
cd sumatra
python setup.py install --user</pre>
<p>Adding &#8211;user to the final command ensures that all packages are installed to your home directory, under .local/lib, so that  you don&#8217;t have to install with sudo privileges, and it makes it a bit easier to remove the package if you don&#8217;t want to keep it.</p>
<p>We also need the GitPython and PyYAML modules, which you may install using apt-get:</p>
<pre>sudo apt-get install python-git python-yaml</pre>
<p>And that&#8217;s it! You should now be able to run your projects with Sumatra.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> This is a new version of <a href="http://dragly.org/2013/04/19/setting-up-unittest-with-qt-creator/">an earlier post</a>, with a revised project structure.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Note 2:</strong> See <a href="http://dragly.org/2015/11/24/getting-started-with-unit-tests-in-qt-creator-with-catch/">this post for the same project structure</a> using the even better Catch testing framework.</em></p>
<p>This post assumes that you are using a C++ testing framework such as UnitTest++. See <a title="Setting up UnitTest++ with Qt Creator in a nice project structure" href="http://dragly.org/2013/04/19/setting-up-unittest-with-qt-creator/">this earlier post</a> for some information on installing UnitTest++ on Ubuntu.</p>
<p>To get the most out UnitTest++ it is a good idea to integrate its output into the Qt Creator IDE. The way I have set this up in Qt Creator is with subprojects. One for the main project, which again is split into the app itself and a library, and one for the tests. In addition, I have a helper project file, named defaults.pri. The structure of the project is like this:</p>
<pre>MyProject
├─ MyProject.pro
├─ defaults.pri
├─ app/
│  ├─ app.pro
│  └─ main.cpp
├─ src/
│  ├─ src.pro
│  └─ myclass.cpp
└─ tests/
   ├─ tests.pro
   └─ main.cpp</pre>
<p>An <a href="https://github.com/ComputationalPhysics/qtcreator-project-structure">example project using this code structure</a> has been posted on Github by Filip Sund. (Thanks to Filip for doing this!)</p>
<p>The main project file, MyProject.pro will now be based on a subdirs template, and may look like this:</p>
<pre>TEMPLATE = subdirs
CONFIG+=ordered
SUBDIRS = \
    src \
    app \
    tests
app.depends = src
tests.depends = src</pre>
<p>The app.depends and tests.depends statements makes sure that the src project is compiled before the application and tests, because the src directory contains the library that will be used by both the app and the tests.</p>
<p>(<a href="http://dragly.org/2014/03/13/new-project-structure-for-projects-in-qt-creator-with-unit-tests/comment-page-1/#comment-19940">Thanks to Will</a> for noting that this works better for parallel builds with make -j 8 than my previous version only using CONFIG+=ordered. We should keep CONFIG+=ordered in there still, though, because depends doesn&#8217;t affect the order when using make install).</p>
<h2>defaults.pri</h2>
<p>Each of the other .pro files will include defaults.pri to have all the headers available. defaults.pri contains the following:</p>
<pre>INCLUDEPATH += $$PWD/src
SRC_DIR = $$PWD</pre>
<p>If the library, main program and tests use common libraries, it is very useful to have the defaults.pri define these dependencies too.</p>
<h2>./src</h2>
<p>In the src folder, I have myclass.cpp, which is the class that I want to use and test. The src.pro needs to compile to a library, so that it may be used both by app and tests, and could look something like this:</p>
<pre>include(../defaults.pri)
CONFIG -= qt

TARGET = myapp
TEMPLATE = lib

SOURCES += myclass.cpp
HEADERS += myclass.h</pre>
<p>What this class does is not so interesting, it could be anything. A simple example could be this header file:</p>
<pre class="brush:c++">#ifndef MYCLASS_H
#define MYCLASS_H

class MyClass {
public:
    double addition(double a, double b);
};

#endif // MYCLASS_H</pre>
<p>With this accompaning source file:</p>
<pre class="brush:c++">#include "myclass.h"

double MyClass::addition(double a, double b) {
    return a * b;
}</pre>
<h2>./app</h2>
<p>I only have a main.cpp file in app, because the app is basically just something that uses everything in the src folder. It will depend on the shared compiled library from src, and app.pro would look something like this:</p>
<pre>include(../defaults.pri)

TEMPLATE = app
CONFIG += console
CONFIG -= app_bundle
CONFIG -= qt

SOURCES += main.cpp

LIBS += -L../src -lmyapp</pre>
<p>The main.cpp file could be a simple program that uses MyClass:</p>
<pre class="brush:c++">#include &lt;myclass.h&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    MyClass adder;
    cout &lt;&lt; adder.addition(10, 20) &lt;&lt; endl;
    return 0;
}</pre>
<h2>./tests</h2>
<p>In the tests folder I have simply added a main.cpp which will run the tests. Then tests.pro has the following contents:</p>
<pre>include(../defaults.pri)
TEMPLATE = app

CONFIG   += console
CONFIG   -= app_bundle
CONFIG   -= qt

SOURCES += main.cpp

LIBS += -lunittest++ -L../src -lmyapp</pre>
<p>Which now links to the myapp library in addition to the unit tests.</p>
<p>The main.cpp in tests file which could contain the following, if we were to use UnitTest++ as our testing library:</p>
<pre class="brush:c++">#include &lt;unittest++/UnitTest++.h&gt;
#include &lt;myclass.h&gt;

TEST(MyMath) {
    MyClass my;
    CHECK(my.addition(3,4) == 7);
}

int main()
{
    return UnitTest::RunAllTests();
}</pre>
<p>This test will fail because my implementation of MyClass::addition is completely wrong:</p>
<pre class="brush:c++">class MyClass {
public:
    double addition(double a, double b) {
        return a * b;
    }
};</pre>
<p>Note that I&#8217;m including MyClass by through &lt;myclass.h&gt; which is possible because of the INCLUDEPATH variable in defaults.pri.</p>
<p>This is hopefully all you&#8217;ll need to define a project that compiles a library, as well as tests and an application using the library.</p>

<p>The stand attracted a fair amount of attention and hopefully convinced some upcoming students to join our university and research group. We got plenty of questions about what was being shown on the TV, how the Oculus Rift controlled the camera in the visualization and of course about the different studies available at the University of Oslo.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this post I will explain  how to write to the binary <a href="http://lammps.sandia.gov/">LAMMPS</a> file format from C++, using data stored in <a href="http://arma.sourceforge.net/">Armadillo</a> vectors and matrices. After running the example in this post you should be able to open the resulting file in <a href="http://ovito.org/">Ovito</a> or any other program capable of reading binary LAMMPS files. The example should also be fairly easy to port to other data structure type, if needed.</p>
<p>For the impatient: You&#8217;ll find a working main.cpp file and a qmake project file <a href="https://github.com/dragly/lammpshandler">on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>The result, if rendered in Ovito, is two silicon atoms (in red) and one oxygen atom:</p>
<p><a href="http://dragly.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/lammps-in-ovito.png" rel="lightbox[537]"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1078" alt="lammps-in-ovito" src="http://dragly.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/lammps-in-ovito-300x259.png" width="300" height="259" /></a></p>
<h2>About the LAMMPS format</h2>
<p><a href="http://lammps.sandia.gov/">LAMMPS</a> is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_dynamics">molecular dynamics</a> simulation package that is extremely versatile with plenty of interaction potentials and features implemented. However, you may have written some other code involving atoms and found yourself in the position of considering using a standard file format to write atom data to file. In this case, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XYZ_file_format">XYZ-format</a> has likely passed your mind, but because this is a ASCII-based text format, it is slow to read and write. This format also lacks standardized headers for information such as the system boundaries &#8211; causing visualizers like Ovito to have to guess for the right boundaries in your system.</p>
<p><span id="more-537"></span></p>
<p>The LAMMPS format is binary, so it is way faster than the XYZ-format, and it also carries with it information about the system, which helps Ovito render everything properly.</p>
<p>The LAMMPS file format consists of an header and column-based data stored as doubles. The header consists of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 × 32-bit integer holding the current time step</li>
<li>1 × 32-bit integer holding the total number of atoms</li>
<li>6 × 64-bit doubles holding the system boundaries</li>
<li>3 × 64-bit doubles holding the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shear_mapping">shearing</a> of the boundaries</li>
<li>1 × 32-bit integer holding the number of columns</li>
<li>1 × 32-bit integer holding the number of chunks</li>
<li>1 × 32-bit integer holding the chunk length, N atoms × n columns.</li>
<li>(N atoms × n columns) × 64 -bit doubles holding the values of all the atom data</li>
</ul>
<h2>What is stored in the columns?</h2>
<p>The 32-bit integer holding the number of columns in the header tells how much data will be stored for each atom. For instance the atom type, 3 position components, 3 velocity components would need 1 + 3 + 3 = 7 columns. The meaning of the data in the columns will have to be interpreted when you open the file in Ovito or any other program, because the LAMMPS format contains no information about the contents of the columns.</p>
<p>Note that all data will have to be stored as 64-bit doubles, even though they might be integers in your application. So you will have to do the conversion to doubles before storing the data to file!</p>
<h2>What are chunks?</h2>
<p>You don&#8217;t really have to care about this. Just store everything as 1 chunk and set the chunk length to the number of columns times the number of atoms (N atoms × n columns).</p>
<p>I think the idea of chunks is used when you build your file with data from multiple processors or split the file up in a logical way to make writing and reading easier for LAMMPS or other applications, but I&#8217;m not sure.</p>
<h2>Get to the code already</h2>
<p>You&#8217;ll find an up-to-date example of this code on <a href="https://github.com/dragly/lammpshandler">Github</a>, but I&#8217;ve included it below as well for reference:</p>
<pre class="brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate">#include &amp;lt;iostream&amp;gt;

// not &amp;quot;shared&amp;quot;)
double xShear = 0.0;
double yShear = 0.0;
double zShear = 0.0;
// nColumns is the number of data types you want to write. In our case we want to
// write four - the atom type and the x, y and z components of the position.
// If you want velocities, forces, etc., just add more columns and write more data.
int nColumns = 1 + 3;
// We could divide the data into chunks by the LAMMPS file format, but we don't - i.e. only
// use one chunk. The chunk length is then the same as the number of atoms times the number
// of columns.
int nChunks = 1;
int chunkLength = nAtomsTotal * nColumns;

// Write all the above to the lammps file
lammpsFile.write(reinterpret_cast&amp;lt;const char*&amp;gt;(&amp;amp;currentTimeStep), sizeof(int));

// Write all the data for each atom to file

// IMPORTANT: Even though atom numbers are usually integers, they must be written

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes you want to copy some data files to the same folder as your final executable when you are building with qmake in a different directory than your source code. This is what Qt Creator does by default, so this is quite often needed.</p>
<p>Just add the following to your .pro file to copy the folder &#8220;data&#8221; from the source directory to the build directory whenever you build the source code:</p>
<pre>copydata.commands = $(COPY_DIR) $$PWD/data $$OUT_PWD
first.depends = $(first) copydata
export(first.depends)
export(copydata.commands)
QMAKE_EXTRA_TARGETS += first copydata</pre>
<p>The meaning of the different names in the above are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>$(COPY_DIR)</strong> &#8211; Holds a platform-dependent copy-command that makes sure to copy recursively.</li>
<li><strong>$$PWD</strong> &#8211; Holds the name of the source code directory, where your .pro file resides.</li>
<li><strong>$$OUT_PWD</strong> &#8211; Holds the name of the build directory. Note that this may not work if you are running qmake and make in the same directory as your source code, as you will be copying into the same folder as you copy from.</li>
<li><strong>copydata</strong> &#8211; Just a name we choose. You can replace this with whatever you want.</li>
<li><strong>first &#8211;</strong> This is a build step that already exists in the Makefile generated by qmake. We attach the copy build step to this build step.</li>
<li><strong>export</strong> &#8211; Makes the variable in the argument of the function available in a global scope.</li>
<li><strong></strong><strong>QMAKE_EXTRA_TARGETS </strong>&#8211; Tells qmake that you want to build more targets than the ones it adds by default to the Makefile.<strong></strong></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>This method is a bit messy, and I wish the Qt developers would make it easier to do this, but it works. It also ensures that the data is always copied, ensuring that any changes in the data folder are pushed to the build folder.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While Qt3D has a transform for drawing billboards, it is not very useful if you are drawing thousands of particles. This is because the transform can only be applied to one object at the time, and using thousands of objects is never a good idea in neither OpenGL or Qt. This is simply because the overhead of each object is very large, both in terms of memory and performance.</p>
<p>The solution I found was to write my own custom class that inherits QQuickItem3D and is capable of drawing a list of 3D points as billboards by directly turning each sprite towards the camera at every draw call. This is not very efficient, but it works and is way faster than the options: Drawing spheres or creating one billboard per particle. The ideal option is of course to use geometry shaders, but they are not easily available in Qt3D yet. Most likely because its a new feature in OpenGL 3.2.</p>
<p>The class <a href="http://github.com/dragly/multibillboard/">is available on GitHub</a> and the resulting output is shown in this screenshot:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://doc-snapshot.qt-project.org/qt3d-1.0/">Qt3D</a> is an amazing library for Qt that gives you the ability to render your own 3D stuff together with your existing widget or QML based GUI. The library was started by the Qt developers a few years back, but has not yet been released with the official Qt SDK. <a href="http://blog.qt.digia.com/blog/2012/04/11/qt-3d-and-qt5-qt4-news-and-releases/">It was announced</a> that it would be bundled with Qt5.0, but because of the state of the library at the time, its release was postponed. Even so, the library is still very mature and appears to work very well in my opinion. So I would urge you to test it out.</p>
<h2>Simple install on Ubuntu</h2>
<p>To use the library you have a couple of different choices. If you are running Ubuntu, you may just run the following commands:</p>
<pre>sudo apt-get install qt3d5-dev qtdeclarative5-qt3d-plugin</pre>
<p>And you should be good to go. Look for examples in the <a href="http://doc-snapshot.qt-project.org/qt3d-1.0/">Qt3D documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Note that Ubuntu currently doesn&#8217;t have QtQuick.Controls available, so you will have to follow the instructions below to combine Qt3D with QtQuick.Controls.</p>
<h2>Install Qt3D into the newest Qt release</h2>
<p>Currently Qt5.1.1 is the newest stable release of Qt and is the version I&#8217;d recommend that you use with Qt3D.</p>
<ol>
<li>Download and install <a href="http://qt-project.org/downloads">Qt5.1.1</a>.</li>
<li>Clone Qt3D from Gitorious:
<pre>git clone git://gitorious.org/qt/qt3d.git qt3d</pre>
</li>
<li>Open QtCreator from your new Qt installation.</li>
<li>Open the qt3d.pro file from the cloned repository and configure it to use the platforms on which you want to use Qt3D (desktop, Android, etc.).</li>
<li>Build for each platform you want to use. Set the build to Release instead of Debug mode while building. You should receive about one hundred warnings if you are building for Android. As always, ignore these.</li>
<li>Open the build folder in a terminal and run
<pre>make install</pre>
<p>This will not install to your system, but to your Qt installation, so that it gets the ability to do awesome 3D stuff.</li>
</ol>
<p>You should now have Qt3D installed in your Qt installation and be ready to run projects that are using Qt3D.</p>
