<p>Every year the the university board chooses a person or group that have shown exceptional work in regards to educational quality and educational environment. And with the prize comes  a reward of the hefty sum 250 000 NOK! The money will be used to further improve the quality of the environment and will serve present and future students and employees at Comp. Phys. !</p>
<p>We are very happy to receive this price and a big thanks to all students and teachers that have been a part of this group to make it what it is today. And a special thankyou must be given to <a href="http://comp-phys.net/author/mhjensen/" target="_blank">Morten Hjort Jensen </a>and<a href="http://comp-phys.net/?author=7" target="_blank"> Anders Malthe-Sørenssen</a> for continuing doing their best to advice and teach with the highest quality.</p>
<p>As for the students at Comp. Phys., they can look forward to enjoying the benefits of the prize money! They money will be used to improve the environment and at the top of the list is to upgrade the equipment and add new furnishing. Specifically a part of the prize has been set aside for two 24&#8243; screens for each student.</p>
