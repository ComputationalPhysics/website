				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey,</p>
<p>so I&#8217;ve had the issue lately that Ctrl+Shift+U was broken on my keyboard when I upgraded to Ubuntu 14.04. My editor went nuts when I pressed it, overwriting parts of the highlighted word that was not even under the cursor. It was a mess.</p>
<p>Anyways, I stumbled upon the fix today. Simply got to Language Support in Ubuntu (available from the search thingie) and switch Keyboard Input Method to &#8220;None&#8221; and restart your computer.</p>
<p>My Alt+Enter is still broken tho, but you can only be so lucky.</p>

<p>Cheers</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey champs,</p>
<p>I recently discovered that the version of gdb that comes with Ubuntu 14.04 is not completelyÂ compatible with the version of gcc that comes with 14.04, that is, gcc 4.8.</p>
<p>Typical signs of misbehavior is that the debugger ends immediately, which is because gdbÂ segfaults when it runs your program, or that the expressions and locals tab is empty in your IDE, or that several functions are skipped in your stack trace.</p>
<p>You can resolve these issues by installing gcc 4.7, however, you will then lose some C++11 functionality such as e.g. constructor inheritance.</p>
<p>Another more technical way of resolving these issues perfectly is to install gdbÂ 4.8. This can be done in the following way:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gdb/gdb-7.8.tar.gz">Download</a> and unpack gdb 4.8.</li>
<li>Enter the unpacked folder and run &#8216;<i>cc=gcc ./configure&#8217;</i></li>
<li>Build gdb by runningÂ <em>make</em> in the directory</li>
<li>If the build fails, you might need to install some more packages, such asÂ <em>Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â &#8216;sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev&#8217;</em></li>
<li>Install gdb by running &#8216;<em>sudo</em>Â <em>make install&#8217;Â </em>in the directory (note that the build needs to be complete). It will install in <i>/usr/local/bin/gdb.</i></li>
<li>Remove the old version of gdb by running &#8216;<em>sudo apt-get remove gdb</em>&#8216;</li>
<li>Create a new symlink toÂ gdb by running &#8216;<em>sudo</em>Â <i>ln -s /usr/local/bin/gdb /usr/bin/gdb</i>&#8216;</li>
</ol>
<p>And you should be good to go ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey champs,</p>
<p>for a while now I&#8217;ve been a fan of the <a title="library/app code design" href="http://localhost/2014/03/24/structuring-larger-projects-using-qmake/">library/app code design</a>Â (see also <a href="http://localhost/2014/03/13/new-project-structure-for-projects-in-qt-creator-with-unit-tests/">this link</a>).</p>
<p>A downside of using such a library centeredÂ designÂ is that you have to care about your libary paths, or more specifically, that your library is seen by the <em>LD_LIBRARY_PATHÂ </em>environment variable. This is parallel to the python path and importing <em>.py</em> files.</p>
<p>PathsÂ are not usually an issue when working from the terminal, since we can easily include anything we want in theÂ <em>.bashrcÂ </em>or equivalent files which are loaded automatically at each terminal launch. This applies to QtCreator as well. All paths existing at the moment QtCreatorÂ is launched will be available to programs launched from within QtCreator.</p>
<p>The problem comes when we want to use the unity icon to launch QtCreator, that is, we do not launch a terminal, hence our environment may be lacking vital paths.</p>
<p>A solution to this issue is to manually add paths in the system environment variable table located in the build options of your project. But this is rather dull. Especially when you have several builds that rely on the same paths.</p>
<p>A better solution is to locate your <em>qtcreator.shÂ </em>file, which is located wherever your may have installed Qt in the first place (you can do a <em>locate qtcreator.shÂ </em>if you really can&#8217;t find it.) and add the following modifications to the thirdÂ last line:</p>
<p><em>LD_LIBRARY_PATH=[your custom paths]:[previous code]</em></p>
<p>whereÂ <em>[your custom paths]Â </em>are whichever paths you wantÂ QtCreator to access at any time in any project from anywhere. Remember to separate all your paths with a colon!</p>
<p>However, this is sadly not enough, since the unity launch app doesn&#8217;t launch QtCreator through the shell script, but rather directly through the executable. To change this, simply replace</p>
<p><em>Exec=/opt/Qt/Tools/QtCreator/bin/qtcreator</em></p>
<p>with</p>
<p><em>Exec=/opt/Qt/Tools/QtCreator/bin/qtcreator.sh</em></p>
<p>in the QtCreator .desktop file. The absolute path in the above codeÂ varies from installation to installation.</p>
<p>The .desktop file is calledÂ <em>DigiaQtOpenSource-qtcreator.desktopÂ </em>and is located in either yourÂ <em>/usr/share/applicationsÂ </em>folder if you used super user privileges when installing it, or <i>~/.local/share/applicationsÂ </i>if you did not.</p>
<p>You should now be good to go ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

So I excourage you to read both posts if you have not read the previous one already.</em></p>
<p>Hey champs,</p>
<p>first of all, let me just say that if you&#8217;re not using <a href="http://qt-project.org/wiki/Category:Tools::QtCreator">Qt Creator</a> for organizing and coding your projects, which uses <a href="http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/qmake-manual.html">QMake</a> intrinsically, the level of this post will be somewhat higher. Nevertheless, I&#8217;ll try to keep to the basics and explain things in a simply way, without all the <a href="http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/jazz">jazz</a>. If you are interested in the jazz, however, I am very interested in discussing it in a separate post or in the comments / over some coffee.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s get to it! This post is aimed at those who develop a code centered around the use solvers, i.e. one implementation of a specific algorithm. Examples could be Molecular Dynamics (MD), Variational Monte-Carlo, Coupled-Cluster, Hartree-Fock, and so on.</p>
<p><strong>Structure your code.</strong>Â Don&#8217;t mash all your files in the same folder. It&#8217;s ugly. I don&#8217;t care if you are using an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment">IDE</a> which displays them in an organized fashion &#8211; it&#8217;s still ugly.</p>
<p><strong>Separate the source code from the rest of the project.Â </strong>Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re coding MD. You may use your implementation to study numerous systems, e.g. basic tempering of Argon, phase coexistence simulations, and so on. A brute force way of implementing multiple uses of a solver is to <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_switch_statement.htm">switch test</a> in the main file and finally simply call <em>run() </em>using whichever objects was initialized in the switch.</p>
<p>However, I will argue that this is a bad way of doing things. Your main file &#8220;main.cpp&#8221; will be awfully cluttered and a hazzle to work with. I would rather suggest you create a separate main file for each of the separate uses of the solver, e.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8230;/MD/apps/argon/argonmain.cpp</li>
<li>&#8230;/MD/apps/phasecoexistence/phasecoexistencemain.cpp</li>
</ul>
<p>and put your source code in</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8230;/MD/src/</li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, if your classes have subclass implementations, they shold be structured in the following way for maximum transparency:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8230;/MD/src/superclass/superclass.h</li>
<li>&#8230;/MD/src/superclass/superclass.cpp</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>&#8230;/MD/src/superclass/subclass/subclass.h</li>
<li>&#8230;/MD/src/superclass/subclass/subclass.cpp</li>
</ul>
<p>Multiple main files require multiple <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing)">executables</a>, as each executable is linked to one specific <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entry_point">main function</a>. However, each of the main function reuse the same code for the algorithm. It is thus recommended to compile the source code to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing)">shared library</a>. You can think if a library as an implementation with the main file removed; exactly what we need.</p>
<p>Another argument for using shared libraries, is that if you doÂ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing">unit testing</a>, you are guaranteed that the same machine code is used for testing and production runs.</p>
<p>Your library file should be placed in</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8230;/MD/lib/</li>
</ul>
<p>The last missing piece now is how to include the library <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/forum/articles/10627/">headers</a> in the main files. The brute force way of doing this is to implement every single header that you need. This is unnecessary. Since the library is built already, there is no <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/makefile/why_makefile.htm">advantage to gain</a> by not including every single header. So you should make a combined header</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8230;/MD/include/MD.h</li>
</ul>
<p>which includes everything you need to use the library to it&#8217;s fullest. For example:</p>
<p><div class='dropshadowboxes-container ' style='width:500px;'>
                            <div class='dropshadowboxes-drop-shadow dropshadowboxes-rounded-corners dropshadowboxes-inside-and-outside-shadow dropshadowboxes-lifted-both dropshadowboxes-effect-default' style=' border: 1px solid #dddddd; height:; background-color:#ffffff;    '>
                            <br />
#pragma once</p>
<p>#include &#8220;../src/stuff.h&#8221;</p>
<p>#include &#8220;../src/superclass/subclass/subclass.h&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8230;
                            </div>
                        </div><br />
</p>
<p>such that your main files can start like the following:</p>
<p><div class='dropshadowboxes-container ' style='width:500px;'>
                            <div class='dropshadowboxes-drop-shadow dropshadowboxes-rounded-corners dropshadowboxes-inside-and-outside-shadow dropshadowboxes-lifted-both dropshadowboxes-effect-default' style=' border: 1px solid #dddddd; height:; background-color:#ffffff;    '>
                            <br />
#include &lt;MD.h&gt;</p>
<p>int main() {</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">}</span>
                            </div>
                        </div><br />
</p>
<p>Do note that this header <em>should never be usedÂ </em>within the library itself,Â <em>only</em> by outside sources which link to the library directly (apps).</p>
<p><strong>So to recap</strong>, we&#8217;ve got some layers of structuring going on now:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8230;/MD/src/ Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â &#8211;Â source code going into the MD solver</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>&#8230;/MD/lib/ Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  &#8211; compiled MD shared library</li>
<li>&#8230;/MD/include/MD.h Â  Â &#8211; complete header for use in main.</li>
<li>&#8230;/MD/apps/ Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  &#8211; specific implementations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Setting up QMakeÂ </strong>for this structure is very simple. First of all we need</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8230;/MD/MD.pro</li>
</ul>
<p><div class='dropshadowboxes-container ' style=''>
                            <div class='dropshadowboxes-drop-shadow dropshadowboxes-rounded-corners dropshadowboxes-inside-and-outside-shadow dropshadowboxes-lifted-both dropshadowboxes-effect-default' style=' border: 1px solid #dddddd; height:; background-color:#ffffff;    '>
                            TEMPLATE = subdirs<br />
CONFIG += ordered</p>
<p>SUBDIRS += src apps</p>
<p>OTHER_FILES += Â $$PWD/include/MD.h
                            </div>
                        </div><br />
</p>
<p>This simply says that we are bulding multiple things; one thing located in <em>src</em>, and another thing located in <em>apps</em>. We are also keeping track of the file <em>MD.h</em>, but we are not using it to build anything.</p>
<p>then we need</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8230;/MD/src/src.pro</li>
</ul>
<p><div class='dropshadowboxes-container ' style=''>
                            <div class='dropshadowboxes-drop-shadow dropshadowboxes-rounded-corners dropshadowboxes-inside-and-outside-shadow dropshadowboxes-lifted-both dropshadowboxes-effect-default' style=' border: 1px solid #dddddd; height:; background-color:#ffffff;    '>
                            include(../defaults.pri)</p>
<p>TEMPLATE = lib<br />
TARGET = ../lib/MD</p>
<p>HEADERS = stuff.h superclass/superclass.h &#8230;</p>
<p>SOURCES = superclass/superclass.cpp &#8230;
                            </div>
                        </div><br />
</p>
<p>where theÂ <em>defaults.pri</em> file includes all the compiler information etc. that is general for everything you build. An example of this is listed <a href="https://github.com/jorgehog/kMC/blob/master/defaults.pri">here</a>.</p>
<p>finally, we need</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8230;/MD/apps/apps.pro</li>
</ul>
<p><div class='dropshadowboxes-container ' style=''>
                            <div class='dropshadowboxes-drop-shadow dropshadowboxes-rounded-corners dropshadowboxes-inside-and-outside-shadow dropshadowboxes-lifted-both dropshadowboxes-effect-default' style=' border: 1px solid #dddddd; height:; background-color:#ffffff;    '>
                            TEMPLATE = subdirs<br />
CONFIG += ordered</p>
<p>SUBDIRS += argon phasecoexistence &#8230;
                            </div>
                        </div><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Implementing an appÂ </strong>is then simply a matter of adding another subdir to the list of <em>apps.pro</em>, and setting up e.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8230;/MD/apps/argon/argon.pro</li>

<p>whereÂ <em>TOP_PWDÂ </em>is set in defaults.pri and references the top MD folder. All in all, this project file setup should enable the easy use of the library as introduced previously.</p>
<p><strong>Using this structure encourages external use of your codeÂ </strong>since it is already set up in such a way that it does not require recompilation and a messy ocean of headers to use. To ensure that all added apps can functionÂ <span style="text-decoration: underline;">independent of the source</span>Â (and thus more easily usable by others) the following lines can be added to the source project file, which ensures that your compiled library file will not remain at a distant build directory which other apps may not know about:</p>
<p><code> !equals(PWD, $${OUT_PWD}) {<br />
QMAKE_POST_LINK += $(COPY_DIR) $$OUT_PWD/../lib $$TOP_PWD<br />
}<br />
</code></p>
<p><strong>Moreover, you should enable <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debug_symbol">debug symbols</a></strong> for your library, so that the debugger will be able to speficy where in your code it crashed (also in src.pro):</p>
<p><div class='dropshadowboxes-container ' style=''>
                            <div class='dropshadowboxes-drop-shadow dropshadowboxes-rounded-corners dropshadowboxes-inside-and-outside-shadow dropshadowboxes-lifted-both dropshadowboxes-effect-default' style=' border: 1px solid #dddddd; height:; background-color:#ffffff;    '>
                            QMAKE_LFLAGS += -g
                            </div>
                        </div><br />
</p>
<p>this is <strong>not default</strong>. however, you may keep this only for debug mode.</p>
<p><strong>For examples</strong> of setups using the methods introduced above, see for example my <a href="https://github.com/jorgehog/QMC2">quantum Monte-Carlo code</a>, or my <a href="https://github.com/jorgehog/kMC">kinetic Monte-Carlo code</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey all,</p>
<p>as many of you know, as codes tend to increase in size, they also (hopefully) tend to become more versatile and more reliant on various parameters to perform a specific task. At this limit, it becomes very dull having to open the code, recompile the code, and all that jazz just to test a new case. In light of this, a very common way to handle all sorts of parameters is through so-called configuration files, or config files for short.</p>
<p>There exists many standards when it comes to config files, however, common to all is that they work around cell blocks. A typical setup would be something like this:</p>
<pre>
FirstCell =
{
    CellInFirstCell =
    {
        someVariable = 2;
    }

}

SecondCell = ...

</pre>
<p>Using interpreted languages like Python, one can use a config library (there exist plenty) which stores all the data in an object from which we can access all the data in the following manner:</p>
<pre>
retrievedData = FirstCell.CellInFirstCell.someVariable
</pre>
<p>Creating this library could be a simple project in lower level programming courses.</p>
<p>For compiled languages, on the other hand, it is not as easy, as the content of the file is not known compile time. Hence we are more reliant on a rigorous yet simple config file library. </p>
<p>The most commonly known cross-language library is <i>json</i>, however, personally, I find that if you do not need the super-duper cross-language support, <i>libconfig++</i> serves as a more clean and elegant library (this is of course open to discussion).</p>
<p>Libconfig for c++ is available through apt-get and is a part of the comp-phys package. If you are not using this package, you can get it by typing</p>
<pre>
sudo apt-get install libconfig++-dev 
</pre>
<p>Parsing the first config file example (which is in libconfig syntax) can be done in the following manner in your c++ program:</p>
<pre>
#include <libconfig.h++>

using namespace libconfig;

int main()
{

    Config cfg;

    cfg.readFile("name_of_config_file");

    const Setting & root = cfg.getRoot();

    int retrievedData = root["FirstCell"]["CellInFirstCell"]["someVariable"];

    ...
    return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>For transparency you could also load entire cells:</p>
<pre>
const Setting & FirstCell = root["FirstCell"];
int retrievedData = FirstCell["CellInFirstCell"]["someVariable"];
</pre>
<p>This is good and all, but what if you have a typo, or type mismatch (e.g. try loading a double into an int)? This brings me to the second topic of this post: Exception handling with libconfig.<br />
If libconfig fails to load a value for some reason, it will simply throw an exception explaining the general nature of the error, that is, either setting not found or type mismatch. The tedious part is that it says nothing about which value failed, neither is it very easy to tell the exceptions apart.</p>
<p>After using the library for some months I decided to do something about this, namely write a wrapper for libconfig which does the exception handling rigorously. You can find the full story on <a href="http://www.github.com/jorgehog/libconfig_utils" title="my github"></a>, but here&#8217;s the short version:</p>
<p>Take the first example use of libconfig. Now, instead of including libconfig directly, we include the utilities header and retrieve the value using the <i>getSetting</i> function:</p>
<pre>
#include <libconfig_utils/libconfig_utils.h>

using namespace libconfig;

int main()
{

    Config cfg;

    cfg.readFile("config.cfg");

    const Setting & root = cfg.getRoot();

    int someVariable = getSetting(root, {"FirstCell",
                                         "CellInFirstCell",
                                         "someVariable"});

    ...
    return 0;
}
</pre>
<p><i>Note: The brackets requires compilation with c++ 11</i></p>
<p>At this point, there is nothing new going on. However, let&#8217;s introduce an error, replacing &#8220;someVariable&#8221; by &#8220;anotherVariable&#8221;. The following error output is then given runtime:</p>
<pre>
Unable to load config key 'anotherVariable' from
 root-->FirstCell-->CellInFirstCell-->anotherVariable
what() : SettingNotFoundException
 Mismatch in given setting name.
</pre>
<p>What is not covered in the previous example is what happens if the typecast fails, i.e. that libconfig finds a mismatch in the format of the variable in the file and the type requested; it simply crashes.</p>
<p>If you want to avoid this, a template type can be specified as follows:</p>
<pre>
int someVariable = getSetting&lt;int&gt;({"FirstCell",
                                   "CellInFirstCell",
                                   "someVariable"});
</pre>
<p>here in the case of a mismatch (i.e. if we set someVariable = 2.0) , the following message appears:</p>
<pre>
Unable to load config key 'someVariable' from
 root-->FirstCell-->CellInFirstCell-->someVariable
what() : SettingTypeException
 Mismatch in given template type and config file variable format.
</pre>
<p>Errors do not necessarily have to be at the bottom level, in which the lower levels will not be indicated:</p>
<pre>
Unable to load config key 'CellInFirstCell_with_typo' from
 root-->FirstCell-->CellInFirstCell_with_typo
what() : SettingNotFoundException
 Mismatch in given setting name.
</pre>
<p>Moreover, we often only want to retrieve a variable from one level down, which means that calling the getSetting function with a list is tedious. If you wish only to read a single variable from the next level, then you will not have to use lists, but can rather use the function <i>getSurfaceSetting</i> as follows:</p>
<pre>
...
    const Setting & root = cfg.getRoot();
    const Setting & mid  = getSetting(root, {"FirstCell", "CellInFirstCell"});

    int someVariable = getSurfaceSetting&lt;int&gt;(mid, "someVariable");
...
</pre>
<p>This is equivalent to dropping the &#8216;Surface&#8217; and adding the string in brackets, but thought of as a more convenient option for single depth parsing.</p>
<p>Note also that in the last example, we saved a variable mid which is a simple libconfig++ Setting object. There is absolutely no difference in the memory address of <i>mid</i> and <i>root[&#8220;FirstCell&#8221;][&#8220;CellInFirstCell&#8221;]</i> by construction.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether you use intermediate storage of cells, the error message will trace back to the root object.</p>
<p>Anyways, that&#8217;s all for now! I hope you guys find a use for it; I use do!</p>
<p>Until next time, enjoy! ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>JÃ¸rgen out</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>this post is a followup on what Svenn-Arne wrote on <a href="http://localhost/2013/11/05/copying-data-files-to-the-build-directory-with-qmake/">copying data files to the build directory with qmake</a>.</p>
<p>It is quite often I find myself in the situation where I need to explicitly create directories for my output each time I rebuild my code, as shipping output directories with the source code just doesn&#8217;t seem right to me.</p>
<p>As far as I know, this is quite normal to do inÂ <em>makefiles, </em>henceÂ the question becomes how to get qmake toÂ Â add the creating of output folders to it&#8217;s resulting makefile.</p>
<p>The answer is simple:</p>
<pre>#List all directories we want created just 
#as we are used to with sources and headers
DIRS = outfiles \
       stuff

#Loop over all given directories and append 
#the build directory to make absolute paths
for(DIR, DIRS) {

     #add these absolute paths to a variable which 
     #ends up as 'mkcommands = path1 path2 path3 ...'
     mkcommands += $$OUT_PWD/$$DIR
}

#make a custom createDir variable with 
#the command mkdir path1 path2 path3 ...
createDirs.commands = $(MKDIR) $$mkcommands

#Do Svenn-Arne explained magic!
first.depends += createDirs
QMAKE_EXTRA_TARGETS += createDirs</pre>
<p>From here on I will refer to Svenn-Arne&#8217;s post for explairnations regarding the qmake variables! My own jibberish is explained below!</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>$(MKDIR)</strong> &#8211; Holds a platform-dependent make directory command that doesn&#8217;t fail if the folder already exists and creates parent directories if necessary.</li>
<li><strong>mkcommands</strong> &#8211; A chosen name, just as for &#8216;copydata&#8217; from Svenn-Arne&#8217;s post.</li>
<li><strong>createDirs</strong> &#8211; A chosen name, just as for &#8216;copydata&#8217; from Svenn-Arne&#8217;s post.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>Enjoy ðŸ™‚</p>

<p>Studying for exams is terribly boring. Tomorrow I&#8217;ll be having my 24&#8217;th and last &#8220;school exam&#8221;, that is, the final exam ever not counting the Master thesis examination. Finding motivation is hard, however, when working through some previous exams in INF3331 I came across the Python <em>HTMLParser</em> and <em>urllib2 </em>modules. The task at hand was dull, so I decided to do something different with these modules, namely write a &#8220;sanntid&#8221; script, which sole task is to fetch data from Ruter and print it in the terminal.</p>
<p>The modules are very easy to use; just look at the script (it&#8217;s awefully commented, but nothing really hard. Just alot of iterators since I didn&#8217;t care for structure&#8230;) As Svenn-Arma Dragly pointed out I could just have parsed the XML-files, but where&#8217;s the fun in that?</p>
<p>The current script only lists Blindern T-bane, however, you can easily append any station to it. Here&#8217;s a little intro in case you choose to use it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Put the sciptfile somewhere</li>
<li>You might need to set executable permissions, i.e. &#8220;<em>chmod +x sanntid.py&#8221;</em></li>
<li>Add an alias in your &#8220;<em>~/.bashrc</em>&#8221; file, i.e. <em>alias sanntid=&#8217;home/user/path/sanntid.py&#8217;</em></li>
<li>Re-open your terminal and type either &#8220;<em>~\$ sanntid v&#8221; </em>for western routes, or &#8220;~<em>\$ sanntid e</em>&#8221; for the eastern ones.</li>
</ol>
<p>The script can be obtained <a href="https://github.com/jorgehog/sanntid_fanger/downloads">here</a>.</p>
<p>The output should then be something like this:</p>
<pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate">

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lately I&#8217;ve been working on parallelizing my Quantum Monte-Carlo library. Common for stochastic sampling methods is the crucial need of error estimates, usually involving the variance in some way or another. Retrieving the single variance given an armadillo vector of samples is trivial</p>
<pre class="brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate">double var = arma::var(data);</pre>
<p>The challange is multinode computing. A brute force solution is to simply use MPI_Gather to concatinate all <em>the data</em> vectors into a single vector on the master node:</p>
<pre class="brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate">
int n = data.n_elem;

double var;

if (is_master) {
   data.resize(n * n_nodes);
   MPI_Gather(MPI_IN_PLACE, n, MPI_DOUBLE, data.memptr(), n, MPI_DOUBLE, 0, MPI_COMM_WORLD);
   var = arma::var(data);
} else {
   MPI_Gather(data.memptr(), n, MPI_DOUBLE, NULL, 0, MPI_DATATYPE_NULL, 0, MPI_COMM_WORLD);
}</pre>
<p>However, in doing this, you communicate n elements per node, or ~10^9 elements for a production run. On top of that, all nodes but the master is idle during the calculation process. Memory is also terribly unbalanced between the nodes.</p>
<p>With that in mind, we would want to optimize these calculations by having all nodes calculate <em>their part of the variance</em>, and then simply combine these local variances into the combined variance.</p>
<p>For <em>uncorrelated </em>samples, this is follows a simple addition rule, however, for stochastic simulations in general, we can assume no such thing. So what now? I googled around a little bit before I came across a <a href="http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/30495/how-to-combine-subsets-consisting-of-mean-variance-confidence-and-number-of-s">simple derivation of the combined variance given local variances</a>.</p>
<p>$$ v=\frac{1}{n-1}\left[\sum_i n_i(m_i-m)^2 + \sum_i(n_i-1)v_i\right]$$</p>
<p>The combined variance can be calculated given the local mean and variance of each node, reducing the communication to a single combined mean calculation in addition to summing a set of doubles:</p>
<pre class="brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate">double combined_mean;

int n = data.n_elem;

double mean = arma::mean(data);
double var = arma::var(data);

MPI_Allreduce(&amp;mean, &amp;combined_mean, 1, MPI_DOUBLE, MPI_SUM, MPI_COMM_WORLD);
combined_mean /= n_nodes;

double combined_var = n * (mean - combined_mean)*(mean - combined_mean) + (n - 1) * var;

if (is_master) {
   MPI_Reduce(MPI_IN_PLACE, &amp;combined_var, 1, MPI_DOUBLE, MPI_SUM, 0, MPI_COMM_WORLD);
   var = combined_var / (n * n_nodes - 1);
} else {
   MPI_Reduce(&amp;combined_var, new double(), 1, MPI_DOUBLE, MPI_SUM, 0, MPI_COMM_WORLD);
}

</pre>
<p>The above code results in exactly the same as the first brute force implementation (given data sample sets are of equal size). Mathematics is useful!</p>

<p>Lately I discovered that intel&#8217;s MKL libraries in combination with MPI is a no-go. <em>mpiexec</em> is not an intel compiler, and does not recognize linking to <em>-lmkl_core </em>etc, which is a problem, since Armadillo depends on it. The solution, however, is intel&#8217;s own MPI compilers, which is <strong>not aviable </strong><strong>gratis</strong> for non-commercial use. Installing lapack on the side did not work either, as Armadillo is configured to wrap MKL if MKL is present (not configurable through config-file).</p>
<p>As a result of this I had to uninstall the intel compilers, and reinstall Armadillo.</p>
<p>This, however, was no hassle. The hassle, however, appeared once I started linking armadillo and lapack in my netbeans editor. I am no computer genie, so I simply added the following lines to <em>compiler options</em></p>
<p>-larmadillo -llapack -lblas</p>
<p>It didn&#8217;t work. I got strange errors from the armadillo wrapper:</p>
<p><em>mpicxx -O3 -larmadillo -llapack -lblasÂ Â Â  -o &#8230; &#8230; &#8230; &#8230;/ExpandedBasis.o</em></p>
<p><em>&#8230;/Fermions.o: In function `getrf&lt;double&gt;&#8217;:</em><br />
<em>/usr/include/armadillo_bits/lapack_wrapper.hpp:42: undefined reference to `dgetrf_&#8217;</em></p>
<p><strong>It didn&#8217;t recognize the lapack linker&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>In these desperate times, the computer genie Svenn-Arma Dragly helped me out by attempting to link his own monte-carlo library like netbeans did. He got exactly the same&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
lapack and Armadillo needs to be added as additional linker options under the linker tab in <em>project properties</em>. They need to appear at theÂ end of the linker sequence,Â and not at the start! They do not need to be listed in compiler options at all&#8230;</p>
<p>Just click the [&#8230;] next toÂ <strong>librariesÂ </strong>and start adding!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
