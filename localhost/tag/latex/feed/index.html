				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Frequently when you include figures in a document you want them as panels within one larger float. Standard procedure is to put a letter on each panel and refer to it like Figure 69g. If you have unlimited space, using the subcaption or subfig packages to assign a letter and caption to each panel is the way to go.</p>
<p>However, if space is limited you usually want a single letter inside the panel. Your options are 1) open the image/plot/whatever in image editing software and put a letter on it; 2) have your plotting routine put the letter on; 3) put the letter on in LaTeX. 1) is a bad idea if you expect the contents of the panel to change, because you have to redo the lettering every time. 2) works better, but gets annoying when you shuffle your panels around, or when you use the same panel in different figures (often in a different document altogether). Here I show you how to do 3).</p>
<p>The idea is simple: use subfig to automatically assign a letter to your panel, but don&#8217;t ask for a caption. Refer to the panel number assigned, but do this within a \put() command, and put the letter returned by \subref somewhere on the panel (I opted for top left, but you can easily change this or move the letter around). You&#8217;re done.</p>
<div id="attachment_769" style="width: 435px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/04/autoLetteringOfPanels.jpg" rel="lightbox[768]"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2014/04/autoLetteringOfPanels.jpg" alt="The figure looks like you expect, and all the subfig functionality is unaffected." width="425" height="427" class="size-full wp-image-769" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2014/04/autoLetteringOfPanels.jpg 425w, wp-content/uploads/2014/04/autoLetteringOfPanels-150x150.jpg 150w, wp-content/uploads/2014/04/autoLetteringOfPanels-298x300.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 425px) 100vw, 425px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The figure looks like you expect, and all the subfig functionality is unaffected.</p></div>
<p><code><br />
\begin{figure}<br />
\panel{.5}{./panel1}{pan:cod}<br />
\panel{.5}{./panel2}{pan:gull}<br />
\caption{Two panels from separate image files with the subfig package and some other commands used to place panel lettering on the panels within LaTeX. \protect\subref{pan:cod} A cod. \protect\subref{pan:gull} A gull.\label{fig:animals}}<br />
\end{figure}<br />
</code></p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/04/AutoLetteringOfPanels.zip">Working example for download.</a></p>
<p>Note that contrary to what Filip said in a recent post, <a href="http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/144782/subfigure-and-subfig-packages-deprecated">subfig is still going strong</a>. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While writing my master thesis I&#8217;ve found that one of the best ways of explaining a lot of concepts is by using illustrations and figures. I make most of my illustrations using <a href="http://www.inkscape.org/" target="_blank">Inkscape</a>, an open source program for making and editing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics" target="_blank">vector graphics</a>.</p>
<p>Using vector graphics mean that all lines in the image is stored as mathematical expressions, contrary to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_graphics" target="_blank">raster graphics</a> where an image is stored by storing the color in each pixel. This means that if you try to zoom in on a raster image, you will get and ugly pixelated image, while if zooming in on a vector image the computer can produce a higher resolution image from the mathematical expressions, as seen in the figure below.</p>
<div id="attachment_724" style="width: 423px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/03/500px-Bitmap_VS_SVG.svg_.png" rel="lightbox[711]"><img class=" wp-image-724   " src="wp-content/uploads/2014/03/500px-Bitmap_VS_SVG.svg_.png" alt="500px-Bitmap_VS_SVG.svg" width="413" height="274" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2014/03/500px-Bitmap_VS_SVG.svg_.png 573w, wp-content/uploads/2014/03/500px-Bitmap_VS_SVG.svg_-300x199.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 413px) 100vw, 413px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">This image illustrates the difference between bitmap and vector images. The bitmap image is composed of a fixed set of dots, while the vector image is composed of a fixed set of shapes. In the picture, scaling the bitmap reveals the dots while scaling the vector image preserves the shapes. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bitmap_VS_SVG.svg">Source</a>.</p></div>
<p>The other advantage of vector images is that if the image consists of a few simple objects, as is the case for most illustrations in my thesis, the image can be stored in a very compact way. This means that the resulting pdf will be smaller in size, while still having nice and high resolution figures.</p>
<h2><strong>Including vector graphics in LaTeX</strong></h2>
<p><em>The impatient can check out a working example in <a href="https://github.com/FSund/latex-examples/tree/master/vector-graphics" target="_blank">this Github repo</a>.</em></p>
<p>The problem is that there hasn&#8217;t been any really good ways of including vector graphics in LaTeX documents. But I recently discovered the package <strong>svg</strong>, which greatly simplifies everything. Using this package you can easily include vector graphics stored in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics" target="_blank">svg</a>-format, which is the default format in Inkscape, by simply using the command</p>
<pre>\includesvg{example} % Note that the file ending is omitted!</pre>
<p>if the name of your image is &#8220;example.svg&#8221;, and adding</p>
<pre>\usepackage{svg}</pre>
<p>to your preamble. Note that this only works if &#8220;example.svg&#8221; is in the same directory as your LaTeX source file (I will come back to how to include images in other locations).</p>
<p>To compile the document you have to allow calling of external functions during compilation, which you do with latex or pdflatex by adding the flag &#8220;&#8211;shell-escape&#8221;:</p>
<pre>pdflatex --shell-escape main.tex</pre>
<p>The way this works is that it uses Inkscape to export the file to a .pdf_tex and a .pdf file. The advantage of doing this is that all text in the figure will have the same formatting as the rest of your document, and that the font can be controlled directly in your LaTeX source file.</p>
<p>One other advantage of using \includesvg{} is that you don&#8217;t have to export your figures from Inkscape every time you make a change to get the new image in your pdf, since the <strong>svg</strong> package does this automatically. The package also knows to only re-export an image if you changed the svg-file.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://ctan.uib.no/graphics/svg/svg.pdf" target="_blank">package documentation</a> does a good job of describing usage and options of the package. An often used option is the width or height of the image, which you control in the usual way</p>
<pre>\includesvg[<strong>width = 0.7\textwidth</strong>]{example}</pre>
<h2><strong>Installing the svg package</strong></h2>
<p>I don&#8217;t think the <strong>svg</strong> package is available in any Ubuntu-package yet, but installing it is as simple as downloading <a href="http://ctan.uib.no/graphics/svg/svg.sty" target="_blank">svg.sty</a> and putting it in your texmf path</p>
<pre>$HOME/texmf/tex/latex/svg</pre>
<p>or putting it in the same directory as your LaTeX source file. You also have to have Inkscape installed, and possibly also imagemagick.</p>
<h2><strong>Inkscape export options</strong></h2>
<p>The default export option the package uses is to export the <em>page</em> of your svg. What you usually want is to export the <em>drawing</em>, so we change this by adding the command<em><br />
</em></p>
<pre>\setsvg{inkscape = inkscape -z -D}</pre>
<p>in the preamble.</p>
<h2><strong>Including files in other locations</strong></h2>
<p>Most of you probably have your images in a different location than your LaTeX source code. The way Inkscape exports svg-files to .pdf_tex and .pdf means that you have to use some special commands to include svg-files in other locations, but this is done by adding some options to the \includesvg{}-command. If your images are located in a directory called &#8220;images&#8221; in the same directory as your main LaTeX file you use</p>
<pre>\includesvg[svgpath = images/]{example} % Note the "/" at the end</pre>
<p>This path can also be set permanently using</p>
<pre>\setsvg{svgpath = images/}</pre>
<h2><strong>Subfig vs subcaption</strong></h2>
<p><em>(Take the section with below with a grain of salt, as according to a <a title="Automatic panel lettering within LaTeX" href="2014/04/04/automatic-panel-lettering-within-latex/">recent blog post</a> here on this blog, the </em>subfig<em> package <a href="http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/144782/subfigure-and-subfig-packages-deprecated">isn&#8217;t depreceated</a> after all.)</em></p>
<p>The <strong>svg</strong> package uses the package <em>subfig</em>, which apparently is deprecated[<a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Floats,_Figures_and_Captions#Subfloats" target="_blank">1</a>][<a href="http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/144782/subfigure-and-subfig-packages-deprecated" target="_blank">2</a>], and should be replaced by for example <em>subcaption</em>. Using <em>subfig</em> and <em>subcaption</em> in the same document doesn&#8217;t work very well, so if you don&#8217;t want to use <em>subfig</em> this can be solved by editing svg.sty. Replace &#8220;subfig&#8221; with &#8220;subcaption&#8221; on line 40 and you&#8217;re done. An working version that uses <em>subcaption</em> can be found <a href="https://github.com/FSund/latex-examples/blob/master/vector-graphics/svg.sty" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently discovered a LaTeX-package called <strong>cleveref</strong>, which simplifies cross-referencing when writing LaTeX-documents. Instead of writing</p>
<pre>see fig. \ref{referencetoawesomething}</pre>
<p>you can write</p>
<pre>see \cref{referencetoawesomething}</pre>
<p><strong>cleveref </strong>will then figure out if what you&#8217;re referencing is a figure, equation, section etc., and translate the <em>\cref{}</em> command to the correct text, for example &#8220;fig. 2.5b&#8221;. You can also reference several things at once using</p>
<pre>\cref{ref1,ref2}</pre>
<p>which will be replaced with for example &#8220;figs. 2.5b and 2.5c&#8221;.</p>
<p>The output of the <em>\cref{}</em> command can naturally be tweaked to output &#8220;Figure 2.5b&#8221;, &#8220;Fig. 2.5b&#8221;, or anything else. <strong>cleveref</strong> also has support for both English and Norwegian, among others.</p>
<p>To use the package you install it in Ubuntu/Linux Mint with</p>
<pre>sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-extra</pre>
<p>and add the following to your preamble</p>
<pre>\usepackage{cleveref}</pre>
<p>See the <a href="http://ctan.uib.no/macros/latex/contrib/cleveref/cleveref.pdf"><strong>cleveref</strong> package documentation</a> for more information and options.</p>
