				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> This is a new version of <a href="http://dragly.org/2013/04/19/setting-up-unittest-with-qt-creator/">an earlier post</a>, with a revised project structure.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Note 2:</strong> See <a href="http://dragly.org/2015/11/24/getting-started-with-unit-tests-in-qt-creator-with-catch/">this post for the same project structure</a> using the even better Catch testing framework.</em></p>
<p>This post assumes that you are using a C++ testing framework such as UnitTest++. See <a title="Setting up UnitTest++ with Qt Creator in a nice project structure" href="http://dragly.org/2013/04/19/setting-up-unittest-with-qt-creator/">this earlier post</a> for some information on installing UnitTest++ on Ubuntu.</p>
<p>To get the most out UnitTest++ it is a good idea to integrate its output into the Qt Creator IDE. The way I have set this up in Qt Creator is with subprojects. One for the main project, which again is split into the app itself and a library, and one for the tests. In addition, I have a helper project file, named defaults.pri. The structure of the project is like this:</p>
<pre>MyProject
├─ MyProject.pro
├─ defaults.pri
├─ app/
│  ├─ app.pro
│  └─ main.cpp
├─ src/
│  ├─ src.pro
│  └─ myclass.cpp
└─ tests/
   ├─ tests.pro
   └─ main.cpp</pre>
<p>An <a href="https://github.com/ComputationalPhysics/qtcreator-project-structure">example project using this code structure</a> has been posted on Github by Filip Sund. (Thanks to Filip for doing this!)</p>
<p>The main project file, MyProject.pro will now be based on a subdirs template, and may look like this:</p>
<pre>TEMPLATE = subdirs
CONFIG+=ordered
SUBDIRS = \
    src \
    app \
    tests
app.depends = src
tests.depends = src</pre>
<p>The app.depends and tests.depends statements makes sure that the src project is compiled before the application and tests, because the src directory contains the library that will be used by both the app and the tests.</p>
<p>(<a href="http://dragly.org/2014/03/13/new-project-structure-for-projects-in-qt-creator-with-unit-tests/comment-page-1/#comment-19940">Thanks to Will</a> for noting that this works better for parallel builds with make -j 8 than my previous version only using CONFIG+=ordered. We should keep CONFIG+=ordered in there still, though, because depends doesn&#8217;t affect the order when using make install).</p>
<h2>defaults.pri</h2>
<p>Each of the other .pro files will include defaults.pri to have all the headers available. defaults.pri contains the following:</p>
<pre>INCLUDEPATH += $$PWD/src
SRC_DIR = $$PWD</pre>
<p>If the library, main program and tests use common libraries, it is very useful to have the defaults.pri define these dependencies too.</p>
<h2>./src</h2>
<p>In the src folder, I have myclass.cpp, which is the class that I want to use and test. The src.pro needs to compile to a library, so that it may be used both by app and tests, and could look something like this:</p>
<pre>include(../defaults.pri)
CONFIG -= qt

TARGET = myapp
TEMPLATE = lib

SOURCES += myclass.cpp
HEADERS += myclass.h</pre>
<p>What this class does is not so interesting, it could be anything. A simple example could be this header file:</p>
<pre class="brush:c++">#ifndef MYCLASS_H
#define MYCLASS_H

class MyClass {
public:
    double addition(double a, double b);
};

#endif // MYCLASS_H</pre>
<p>With this accompaning source file:</p>
<pre class="brush:c++">#include "myclass.h"

double MyClass::addition(double a, double b) {
    return a * b;
}</pre>
<h2>./app</h2>
<p>I only have a main.cpp file in app, because the app is basically just something that uses everything in the src folder. It will depend on the shared compiled library from src, and app.pro would look something like this:</p>
<pre>include(../defaults.pri)

TEMPLATE = app
CONFIG += console
CONFIG -= app_bundle
CONFIG -= qt

SOURCES += main.cpp

LIBS += -L../src -lmyapp</pre>
<p>The main.cpp file could be a simple program that uses MyClass:</p>
<pre class="brush:c++">#include &lt;myclass.h&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    MyClass adder;
    cout &lt;&lt; adder.addition(10, 20) &lt;&lt; endl;
    return 0;
}</pre>
<h2>./tests</h2>
<p>In the tests folder I have simply added a main.cpp which will run the tests. Then tests.pro has the following contents:</p>
<pre>include(../defaults.pri)
TEMPLATE = app

CONFIG   += console
CONFIG   -= app_bundle
CONFIG   -= qt

SOURCES += main.cpp

LIBS += -lunittest++ -L../src -lmyapp</pre>
<p>Which now links to the myapp library in addition to the unit tests.</p>
<p>The main.cpp in tests file which could contain the following, if we were to use UnitTest++ as our testing library:</p>
<pre class="brush:c++">#include &lt;unittest++/UnitTest++.h&gt;
#include &lt;myclass.h&gt;

TEST(MyMath) {
    MyClass my;
    CHECK(my.addition(3,4) == 7);
}

int main()
{
    return UnitTest::RunAllTests();
}</pre>
<p>This test will fail because my implementation of MyClass::addition is completely wrong:</p>
<pre class="brush:c++">class MyClass {
public:
    double addition(double a, double b) {
        return a * b;
    }
};</pre>
<p>Note that I&#8217;m including MyClass by through &lt;myclass.h&gt; which is possible because of the INCLUDEPATH variable in defaults.pri.</p>
<p>This is hopefully all you&#8217;ll need to define a project that compiles a library, as well as tests and an application using the library.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I love unit testing. First of all, I think it is a good idea to test separate units of the code, but after doing so for some time, I&#8217;ve come to realize that unit tests are great for managing the software development cycle too. It all boils down to the idea that you should write tests before you write your code.</p>
<p>Now, this is something that I and others apparently struggle a lot with. How do you write a test for some code that doesn&#8217;t even exist yet? Even worse, how do you write a test for a piece of software that you&#8217;re not yet sure how will be used?</p>
<p>In computational physics, this problem arises often because we are writing code at the same time as we are trying to understand the physics, mathematics and algorithms at hand. And this is a good thing. You might want to think that one should structure all code before it is written, but this is generally a bad approach in computational physics. Especially if you&#8217;re working on something new. The reason is that you will often understand the problem and algorithms better while developing, rather than just reading about them and trying to analyze them blindly.</p>
<h2>Keeping the tests and code healthy</h2>
<p>But enough with the talk, let&#8217;s just assume that you are convinced that you should (or have to) implement some unit tests. At one point you are likely to be in a position where you find it tiresome to have to go into that folder where the tests are defined and run them manually. This is where Jenkins comes in to play.</p>
<p><span id="more-465"></span></p>
<p>Jenkins is a build bot that is designed to fetch your code from wherever, download, build and run the commands you need to test your code. It also provides a very nice web interface that will allow you to keep track of which builds are working and which are not.</p>
<p><a href="http://dragly.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/jenkins.png" rel="lightbox[465]"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-947" alt="jenkins" src="http://dragly.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/jenkins-e1379054595973-800x280.png" width="640" height="224" /></a>After running tests manually for way too long, this is exactly what I needed. I have already written a post about how you can <a title="Setting up UnitTest++ with Qt Creator" href="http://dragly.org/2013/04/19/setting-up-unittest-with-qt-creator/">launch your tests after building your project in Qt Creator</a>, but this has the disadvantage that your code will be compiled twice whenever you build it, and you&#8217;ll have to wait for the tests to finish before actually seeing your code run. With Jenkins, everything happens in the background. And Jenkins can be configured to run builds periodically, whenever your source code changes or is pushed to Git.</p>
<h2>Setting up Jenkins with access to Git and local folders on Ubuntu</h2>
<p>Installing Jenkins on Ubuntu is a piece of cake:</p>
<pre>sudo apt-get install jenkins</pre>
<p>However, you might want Jenkins to be able to pull your source code and build it from a remote Git repository, or even more obvious, access your projects on your local drive, which it is not able to do by default(!).</p>
<h3>Installing the Git plugin</h3>
<p>After installing Jenkins, you should immediately be able to access it through this page:</p>
<p><a href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a></p>
<p>To install the Git plugin, go to <em>Manage Jenkins</em> → <em>Manage plugins</em> → <em>Available</em> and search for &#8220;git&#8221;. You should install the plugin named <a href="http://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Git+Plugin">Jenkins GIT plugin</a>. If you click this link, you should see the same page as you do if you click the link in the list.</p>
<p>Note that on Ubuntu 13.10 you will also have to install the Mailer plugin. This is a dependency of the Git plugin, but it is currently not listed, so you will have to install it manually for now.</p>
<h3>Optional: Allowing Jenkins access to your private Github repository</h3>
<p>This step is optional. If you only want to use Jenkins for public repositories, you may skip this step.</p>
<p>Jenkins needs its own SSH key to access private Github repositories. If you&#8217;re not familiar with SSH keys and Github, this is a good time to <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys">read a bit about it</a>.</p>
<p>To generate this key, we&#8217;ll log in to the jenkins user in your Ubuntu terminal:</p>
<pre>sudo su jenkins</pre>
<p>Then run</p>
<pre>ssh-keygen</pre>
<p>and go through the steps to generate your key. Then print your key to screen so you may copy and paste it to Github:</p>
<pre>cat /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</pre>
<p>Copy and paste the key to Github. Then, by still being logged in as jenkins, run the following command to verify Github as a proper SSH host:</p>
<pre>ssh git@github.com</pre>
<p>You should receive a prompt like this:</p>
<pre>PTY allocation request failed on channel 0
Hi dragly! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
Connection to github.com closed.</pre>
<p>Now log out of jenkins by clicking CTRL+D.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it! Jenkins now should have access both to public and private repositories.</p>
<h3>Optional: Allowing Jenkins access to your files</h3>
<p>This step is optional. If you only want to use Jenkins for Git projects, you may skip this step.</p>
<p>By default, and this is for security reasons, Jenkins doesn&#8217;t have access to your files on your computer. So if you want to launch a set of unit tests in your home folder, you will need to give Jenkins access to these. The easiest way to do this is by adding the jenkins user to your group. Just replace your_user_name below:</p>
<pre>usermod -G your_user_name jenkins</pre>
<p>Jenkins will now be able to access your files.</p>
<h3>Optional: Adding some extra security by setting up a firewall</h3>
<p>Jenkins uses port 8080 on your computer and by default allows anyone to access its services through this port. While you may mess around with Jenkins&#8217; settings to set up user authentication, I found it better just to enable a firewall in Ubuntu and restrict inbound access on all ports (except the ones I use for other things).</p>
<p>Download and install <em>Firewall Configuration</em> from Ubuntu Software Center. And turn it on like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://dragly.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/firewall.png" rel="lightbox[465]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948" alt="firewall" src="http://dragly.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/firewall-e1379055216219.png" width="361" height="174" /></a>Now your Jenkins bot won&#8217;t allow anyone else access to run jobs on your machine.</p>
<h2>Setting up your first project</h2>
<p>Click <em>Jenkins</em> → <em>New job</em> and give it a name of your choice. Select <b>Build a free-style software project</b> as your setting and click OK.</p>
<p><a href="http://dragly.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/newjob.png" rel="lightbox[465]"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-949" alt="newjob" src="http://dragly.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/newjob-e1379055794391-800x235.png" width="640" height="188" /></a>In the next window, select Git as the <em>Source Code Management</em> option and enter your repository URL with http as the access method. If it is a private repository, follow the steps above to give Jenkins access to it, and use SSH as your access method.</p>
<p><a href="http://dragly.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/jenkins-git.png" rel="lightbox[465]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-953" alt="jenkins-git" src="http://dragly.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/jenkins-git.png" width="565" height="184" /></a></p>
<p>Further down, add an <em>Execute shell</em> build step:</p>
<p><a href="http://dragly.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/build-step.png" rel="lightbox[465]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954" alt="build-step" src="http://dragly.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/build-step.png" width="548" height="125" /></a></p>
<p>This allows you to type in whatever commands are needed to run before the build may be tested. In my case, it would be to do something like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://dragly.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/execute-shell2.png" rel="lightbox[465]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958" alt="execute-shell" src="http://dragly.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/execute-shell2.png" width="516" height="259" /></a>After doing so, click <em>Apply</em> and test your build by clicking <em>Build now</em>.</p>
<h3>Checking the output</h3>
<p>What Jenkins does now is to clone your repository into a temporary folder and execute the commands given in the <em>Execute shell </em>text box. You may check the result by looking at the <em>Build History</em> on the left hand side of the screen. Blue means unstable (crashed) build, red means stable build. Hover the pointer over a build and click <em>Console output</em> to see the exact output of the build. This is very useful if the build should fail and you want to know why.</p>
<p><a href="http://dragly.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/build-history.png" rel="lightbox[465]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959" alt="build-history" src="http://dragly.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/build-history.png" width="215" height="114" /></a>If all goes well, you may explore the options to build whenever your source code changes or periodically, by looking at the <em>Build triggers</em>.</p>
<p>There are also plenty of other features in Jenkins, but I&#8217;ll leave it up to you to explore them all. The last thing you should do before you stop playing around is to add Jenkins as your browser&#8217;s start up page and always keep it visible on a screen so that you at any given time know how your builds perform.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you reading random stuff on the web while waiting for your C++ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler">compilation</a> to finish? Then you have come to the right place. In this post I will tell you about two really nice tweaks you may do to speed up your compilations, namely ccache and the make -j flag, and how you may set these up in Qt Creator.</p>
<h2>ccache</h2>
<p>ccache is a clever tool that wraps you compiler (g++ or mpicxx) and understands whether the file you are compiling has been compiled before with exactly the same contents and settings. If it has, it just returns a cached result.</p>
<p>Unlike regular make, ccache is extremely good at detecting the true state of what you are compiling. I have never had any trouble with ccache.</p>
<p>This really speeds up the compilation when you are using make clean, especially if you are switching git branches. In other words, it is a much simpler solution to achieve fast compilation with git branches than to create separate build folders for each branch.</p>
<p>To enable ccache, install it with</p>
<pre class="brush:shell">sudo apt-get install ccache</pre>
<p>and add the following to your .pro file:</p>
<pre class="brush:shell">QMAKE_CXX = ccache g++</pre>
<p>Replace g++ with mpicxx if you are using MPI.</p>
<h2>The make -j flag</h2>
<p>I realized when compiling the Qt source that make has a -j flag that enables threaded compilation on all available processors on the machine. This also speeds up compilation significantly, and I made a 3.55x performance gain on a 4 core CPU. To enable this flag, go to the Projects view in Qt Creator and add the following arguments to the make build step:</p>
<pre class="brush:shell">-j</pre>
<p>This should look something like this afterwards:</p>
<div id="attachment_918" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://dragly.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/makej-qtcreator.png" rel="lightbox[414]"><img class="size-large wp-image-918" alt="This is how your project settings should look like after adding the -j option to make." src="http://dragly.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/makej-qtcreator-800x213.png" width="640" height="170" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">This is how your project settings should look like after adding the -j option to make.</p></div>
<p>If you prefer not to use all available processors for compilation, you may add a number after -j to set the number of processors. For instance make -j 3 would compile with 3 processors.</p>
