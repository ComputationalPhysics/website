				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> This is a new version of <a href="http://dragly.org/2013/04/19/setting-up-unittest-with-qt-creator/">an earlier post</a>, with a revised project structure.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Note 2:</strong> See <a href="http://dragly.org/2015/11/24/getting-started-with-unit-tests-in-qt-creator-with-catch/">this post for the same project structure</a> using the even better Catch testing framework.</em></p>
<p>This post assumes that you are using a C++ testing framework such as UnitTest++. See <a title="Setting up UnitTest++ with Qt Creator in a nice project structure" href="http://dragly.org/2013/04/19/setting-up-unittest-with-qt-creator/">this earlier post</a> for some information on installing UnitTest++ on Ubuntu.</p>
<p>To get the most out UnitTest++ it is a good idea to integrate its output into the Qt Creator IDE. The way I have set this up in Qt Creator is with subprojects. One for the main project, which again is split into the app itself and a library, and one for the tests. In addition, I have a helper project file, named defaults.pri. The structure of the project is like this:</p>
<pre>MyProject
├─ MyProject.pro
├─ defaults.pri
├─ app/
│  ├─ app.pro
│  └─ main.cpp
├─ src/
│  ├─ src.pro
│  └─ myclass.cpp
└─ tests/
   ├─ tests.pro
   └─ main.cpp</pre>
<p>An <a href="https://github.com/ComputationalPhysics/qtcreator-project-structure">example project using this code structure</a> has been posted on Github by Filip Sund. (Thanks to Filip for doing this!)</p>
<p>The main project file, MyProject.pro will now be based on a subdirs template, and may look like this:</p>
<pre>TEMPLATE = subdirs
CONFIG+=ordered
SUBDIRS = \
    src \
    app \
    tests
app.depends = src
tests.depends = src</pre>
<p>The app.depends and tests.depends statements makes sure that the src project is compiled before the application and tests, because the src directory contains the library that will be used by both the app and the tests.</p>
<p>(<a href="http://dragly.org/2014/03/13/new-project-structure-for-projects-in-qt-creator-with-unit-tests/comment-page-1/#comment-19940">Thanks to Will</a> for noting that this works better for parallel builds with make -j 8 than my previous version only using CONFIG+=ordered. We should keep CONFIG+=ordered in there still, though, because depends doesn&#8217;t affect the order when using make install).</p>
<h2>defaults.pri</h2>
<p>Each of the other .pro files will include defaults.pri to have all the headers available. defaults.pri contains the following:</p>
<pre>INCLUDEPATH += $$PWD/src
SRC_DIR = $$PWD</pre>
<p>If the library, main program and tests use common libraries, it is very useful to have the defaults.pri define these dependencies too.</p>
<h2>./src</h2>
<p>In the src folder, I have myclass.cpp, which is the class that I want to use and test. The src.pro needs to compile to a library, so that it may be used both by app and tests, and could look something like this:</p>
<pre>include(../defaults.pri)
CONFIG -= qt

TARGET = myapp
TEMPLATE = lib

SOURCES += myclass.cpp
HEADERS += myclass.h</pre>
<p>What this class does is not so interesting, it could be anything. A simple example could be this header file:</p>
<pre class="brush:c++">#ifndef MYCLASS_H
#define MYCLASS_H

class MyClass {
public:
    double addition(double a, double b);
};

#endif // MYCLASS_H</pre>
<p>With this accompaning source file:</p>
<pre class="brush:c++">#include "myclass.h"

double MyClass::addition(double a, double b) {
    return a * b;
}</pre>
<h2>./app</h2>
<p>I only have a main.cpp file in app, because the app is basically just something that uses everything in the src folder. It will depend on the shared compiled library from src, and app.pro would look something like this:</p>
<pre>include(../defaults.pri)

TEMPLATE = app
CONFIG += console
CONFIG -= app_bundle
CONFIG -= qt

SOURCES += main.cpp

LIBS += -L../src -lmyapp</pre>
<p>The main.cpp file could be a simple program that uses MyClass:</p>
<pre class="brush:c++">#include &lt;myclass.h&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    MyClass adder;
    cout &lt;&lt; adder.addition(10, 20) &lt;&lt; endl;
    return 0;
}</pre>
<h2>./tests</h2>
<p>In the tests folder I have simply added a main.cpp which will run the tests. Then tests.pro has the following contents:</p>
<pre>include(../defaults.pri)
TEMPLATE = app

CONFIG   += console
CONFIG   -= app_bundle
CONFIG   -= qt

SOURCES += main.cpp

LIBS += -lunittest++ -L../src -lmyapp</pre>
<p>Which now links to the myapp library in addition to the unit tests.</p>
<p>The main.cpp in tests file which could contain the following, if we were to use UnitTest++ as our testing library:</p>
<pre class="brush:c++">#include &lt;unittest++/UnitTest++.h&gt;
#include &lt;myclass.h&gt;

TEST(MyMath) {
    MyClass my;
    CHECK(my.addition(3,4) == 7);
}

int main()
{
    return UnitTest::RunAllTests();
}</pre>
<p>This test will fail because my implementation of MyClass::addition is completely wrong:</p>
<pre class="brush:c++">class MyClass {
public:
    double addition(double a, double b) {
        return a * b;
    }
};</pre>
<p>Note that I&#8217;m including MyClass by through &lt;myclass.h&gt; which is possible because of the INCLUDEPATH variable in defaults.pri.</p>
<p>This is hopefully all you&#8217;ll need to define a project that compiles a library, as well as tests and an application using the library.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://doc-snapshot.qt-project.org/qt3d-1.0/">Qt3D</a> is an amazing library for Qt that gives you the ability to render your own 3D stuff together with your existing widget or QML based GUI. The library was started by the Qt developers a few years back, but has not yet been released with the official Qt SDK. <a href="http://blog.qt.digia.com/blog/2012/04/11/qt-3d-and-qt5-qt4-news-and-releases/">It was announced</a> that it would be bundled with Qt5.0, but because of the state of the library at the time, its release was postponed. Even so, the library is still very mature and appears to work very well in my opinion. So I would urge you to test it out.</p>
<h2>Simple install on Ubuntu</h2>
<p>To use the library you have a couple of different choices. If you are running Ubuntu, you may just run the following commands:</p>
<pre>sudo apt-get install qt3d5-dev qtdeclarative5-qt3d-plugin</pre>
<p>And you should be good to go. Look for examples in the <a href="http://doc-snapshot.qt-project.org/qt3d-1.0/">Qt3D documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Note that Ubuntu currently doesn&#8217;t have QtQuick.Controls available, so you will have to follow the instructions below to combine Qt3D with QtQuick.Controls.</p>
<h2>Install Qt3D into the newest Qt release</h2>
<p>Currently Qt5.1.1 is the newest stable release of Qt and is the version I&#8217;d recommend that you use with Qt3D.</p>
<ol>
<li>Download and install <a href="http://qt-project.org/downloads">Qt5.1.1</a>.</li>
<li>Clone Qt3D from Gitorious:
<pre>git clone git://gitorious.org/qt/qt3d.git qt3d</pre>
</li>
<li>Open QtCreator from your new Qt installation.</li>
<li>Open the qt3d.pro file from the cloned repository and configure it to use the platforms on which you want to use Qt3D (desktop, Android, etc.).</li>
<li>Build for each platform you want to use. Set the build to Release instead of Debug mode while building. You should receive about one hundred warnings if you are building for Android. As always, ignore these.</li>
<li>Open the build folder in a terminal and run
<pre>make install</pre>
<p>This will not install to your system, but to your Qt installation, so that it gets the ability to do awesome 3D stuff.</li>
</ol>
<p>You should now have Qt3D installed in your Qt installation and be ready to run projects that are using Qt3D.</p>
