		<description><![CDATA[Thanks..I got the instructions to work.   The  Curvelab and  rwt need to be compiled in separate directories than MCALab..later on, the respective .mex files in the MCALab can be changed by those from Curvelab and rwt (which is my preference).

This was very useful for me and thanks again for the post.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi 
This is very useful but I couldn&#039;t get it running and could use some extra help.
First:
your comment: &quot;-fPIC to CXXFLAGS.&quot;
I didn&#039;t see any such lines in FFTW but I saw CFLAGS.  Does this line pertain to the Curvelab directory or to the FFTW directory
Second you said:
&quot;mkdir fftw/.libs  
cp lib/libfftw.a fftw/.libs/libfftw.a 

Finally I don&#039;t see the file 
cp lib/libfftw.so fftw/.libs/libfftw.so in the fftw directory..

Again is this in the curvelab directory?  What happes to FFTW?   Also does the command mkdir fftw./libs  work in Ubuntu?  

Alittle clarification on which directoryies one should be in these two/three steps would be great...]]></description>
