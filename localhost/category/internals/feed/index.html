				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What are Personal Packaging Archives (PPA)? They are currently the easiest way to serve Ubuntu packages to users through a repository that will also push out updates when they are available. Sadly, it is not as easy as it could have been, but it works, and for the end user it is very simple.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why we set up our own PPA for the Computational Physics group. A PPA is something which works best if several people are using and contributing to it. If you want to help out with maintaining the <a href="https://launchpad.net/~comp-phys/+archive/stable">Computational Physics PPA</a>, you need to do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a user on <a href="https://launchpad.net/">Launchpad</a>.</li>
<li>Create a GPG key if you don&#8217;t have one:
<pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">gpg --gen-key</pre>
</li>
<li>Find the ID and fingerprint of your key:
<pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">gpg --list-keys</pre>
<p>The ID should be a string of about 8 letters and digits, for instance 9ABC6F7G.<br />
The fingerprint is on the form <code>27E0 7815 B47C 0397 90D5  8589 27D9 A27B F3F9 6058</code></li>
<li>Upload this to the Ubuntu key server:
<pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">gpg --send-keys --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com YOUR_KEY_ID</pre>
</li>
<li>Log in to your Launchpad account, visit your profile and click the yellow pencil icon next to OpenPGP keys. Insert your key fingerprint and click Import Key.</li>
</ol>
<p>You are now registered and ready to help out maintaining. Send me a message and I will give you access to the Computational Physics team.</p>
<p>You may for instance help out with the packages, which I will write a guide on later, and to have a look at what&#8217;s currently available you may either add the PPA and download a source package:</p>
<pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">sudo apt-add-repository ppa:comp-phys/stable
sudo apt-get update
apt-get source comp-phys</pre>
<p>This may then be reuploaded later using debuild and dput:</p>
<pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">cd comp-phys
( do some changes )
debuild -S
dput ppa:comp-phys/stable ../comp-phys-minimal_0.0.2_source.changes</pre>
<p>Or you could clone the git repository that also contains the package, which should be located at our <a href="https://github.com/ComputationalPhysics">GitHub account</a>. This is currently where the comp-phys and comp-phys-minimal package sources reside, which you find in <a href="https://github.com/ComputationalPhysics/packages">this repository</a>.</p>
