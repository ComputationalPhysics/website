				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The classical molecular dynamics is primarily based on classical motion of atoms interacting with a given potential.  Quantum molecular dynamics, on the other hand, focuses on all the interactions between atoms and electrons, and does not involve fitting interactions to experimental data.  An approach to include the electronic structure is to solve the electronic Schrödinger equation, given the set of fixed nuclear positions, in each molecular dynamics step and let the nuclei to move according to classical mechanics in an effective potential due to the electrons.</p>
<p>In the last two weeks I have been working on calculating this effective  potential, based on the results from my Hartree-Fock code.  The forces acting on the nuclei are found by taking the gradient of the energy with respect to the nuclei positions. Below I have included  molecular dynamics simulation of $H_2$  and $H_2O$ molecule, where the effective potential is calculated in each time step.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a part of my master project, I have lately  been working on  developing a Hartree-Fock (HF) code for atomic and molecular systems.   The Hartree-Fock method is the simplest many-body theory and a central starting point for most methods that describe the many-electron system more accurately. One of the advantages of HF is its low computational cost compare to more sophisticated techniques, which makes it attractive for quantum molecular dynamics studies.</p>
<p>Our HF code is based on gaussian basis sets, which makes the integral evaluations much easier and gives a huge computational saving.  However, by taking into account the symmetries in one-body and two-body integrals, the computational cost can be reduced even further.  Since the basis functions and matrix elements  are real, we have the following symmetries</p>
<p>$$\langle i |\hat{h}|j \rangle = \langle j |\hat{h}|i \rangle $$</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>$$\langle i k|jl \rangle = \langle jk |il \rangle =  \langle il |jk \rangle = \langle jl |ik \rangle =\langle ki |lj \rangle = \langle li |kj \rangle = \langle kj| li \rangle=  \langle lj |ki \rangle $$</p>
<p>for one-body and two-body matrix elements, respectively. Having implemented these symmetries, the computation time for  the ground state energy for a single water molecule (using 4-31G basis set) went from 6 sec to 1 sec, which is a huge speed up! For more details please check out this <a href="http://theoretical-physics.net/dev/src/quantum/hf.html">site</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ovito is a great tool to visualize atoms from molecular dynamics simulations and to perform some statistical analysis on the data. The tool is an alternative to other similar tools such as VMD and ParaView.</p>
<p>The current version of Ovito in the Ubuntu repositories (version 0.9.2) is sadly very outdated. Even though you of course may download the latest version from Ovito&#8217;s webpages and install it locally in your home folder, I often find it better to get a newer package version.</p>
<p>At the Computational Physics group&#8217;s PPA I have now uploaded the latest build of Ovito for Ubuntu in a package that will automatically replace the current Ovito version. Note that this is not a release version of Ovito, but the latest version fetched from Ovito&#8217;s sources (currently nicknamed 1.1.1.90). The reason is that Ovito&#8217;s creator, Alexander Stukowski, was kind enough to implement a suggestion we proposed to change the default input handler for the viewports to be the orbit input handler. This behavior feels so much more natural and makes the already great Ovito application even better.</p>
<p>To install the latest version of Ovito, all you need to do is to open up a terminal and type these lines:</p>
<pre class="brush:shell">sudo apt-add-repository ppa:comp-phys/stable
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ovito</pre>
<p>Note that the Computational Physics repository also contains newer versions of the Armadillo package, which will automatically be updated if you do not remove the repository after installing Ovito.</p>
