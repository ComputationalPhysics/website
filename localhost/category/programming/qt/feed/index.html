				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> This is a new version of <a href="http://dragly.org/2013/04/19/setting-up-unittest-with-qt-creator/">an earlier post</a>, with a revised project structure.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Note 2:</strong> See <a href="http://dragly.org/2015/11/24/getting-started-with-unit-tests-in-qt-creator-with-catch/">this post for the same project structure</a> using the even better Catch testing framework.</em></p>
<p>This post assumes that you are using a C++ testing framework such as UnitTest++. See <a title="Setting up UnitTest++ with Qt Creator in a nice project structure" href="http://dragly.org/2013/04/19/setting-up-unittest-with-qt-creator/">this earlier post</a> for some information on installing UnitTest++ on Ubuntu.</p>
<p>To get the most out UnitTest++ it is a good idea to integrate its output into the Qt Creator IDE. The way I have set this up in Qt Creator is with subprojects. One for the main project, which again is split into the app itself and a library, and one for the tests. In addition, I have a helper project file, named defaults.pri. The structure of the project is like this:</p>
<pre>MyProject
├─ MyProject.pro
├─ defaults.pri
├─ app/
│  ├─ app.pro
│  └─ main.cpp
├─ src/
│  ├─ src.pro
│  └─ myclass.cpp
└─ tests/
   ├─ tests.pro
   └─ main.cpp</pre>
<p>An <a href="https://github.com/ComputationalPhysics/qtcreator-project-structure">example project using this code structure</a> has been posted on Github by Filip Sund. (Thanks to Filip for doing this!)</p>
<p>The main project file, MyProject.pro will now be based on a subdirs template, and may look like this:</p>
<pre>TEMPLATE = subdirs
CONFIG+=ordered
SUBDIRS = \
    src \
    app \
    tests
app.depends = src
tests.depends = src</pre>
<p>The app.depends and tests.depends statements makes sure that the src project is compiled before the application and tests, because the src directory contains the library that will be used by both the app and the tests.</p>
<p>(<a href="http://dragly.org/2014/03/13/new-project-structure-for-projects-in-qt-creator-with-unit-tests/comment-page-1/#comment-19940">Thanks to Will</a> for noting that this works better for parallel builds with make -j 8 than my previous version only using CONFIG+=ordered. We should keep CONFIG+=ordered in there still, though, because depends doesn&#8217;t affect the order when using make install).</p>
<h2>defaults.pri</h2>
<p>Each of the other .pro files will include defaults.pri to have all the headers available. defaults.pri contains the following:</p>
<pre>INCLUDEPATH += $$PWD/src
SRC_DIR = $$PWD</pre>
<p>If the library, main program and tests use common libraries, it is very useful to have the defaults.pri define these dependencies too.</p>
<h2>./src</h2>
<p>In the src folder, I have myclass.cpp, which is the class that I want to use and test. The src.pro needs to compile to a library, so that it may be used both by app and tests, and could look something like this:</p>
<pre>include(../defaults.pri)
CONFIG -= qt

TARGET = myapp
TEMPLATE = lib

SOURCES += myclass.cpp
HEADERS += myclass.h</pre>
<p>What this class does is not so interesting, it could be anything. A simple example could be this header file:</p>
<pre class="brush:c++">#ifndef MYCLASS_H
#define MYCLASS_H

class MyClass {
public:
    double addition(double a, double b);
};

#endif // MYCLASS_H</pre>
<p>With this accompaning source file:</p>
<pre class="brush:c++">#include "myclass.h"

double MyClass::addition(double a, double b) {
    return a * b;
}</pre>
<h2>./app</h2>
<p>I only have a main.cpp file in app, because the app is basically just something that uses everything in the src folder. It will depend on the shared compiled library from src, and app.pro would look something like this:</p>
<pre>include(../defaults.pri)

TEMPLATE = app
CONFIG += console
CONFIG -= app_bundle
CONFIG -= qt

SOURCES += main.cpp

LIBS += -L../src -lmyapp</pre>
<p>The main.cpp file could be a simple program that uses MyClass:</p>
<pre class="brush:c++">#include &lt;myclass.h&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    MyClass adder;
    cout &lt;&lt; adder.addition(10, 20) &lt;&lt; endl;
    return 0;
}</pre>
<h2>./tests</h2>
<p>In the tests folder I have simply added a main.cpp which will run the tests. Then tests.pro has the following contents:</p>
<pre>include(../defaults.pri)
TEMPLATE = app

CONFIG   += console
CONFIG   -= app_bundle
CONFIG   -= qt

SOURCES += main.cpp

LIBS += -lunittest++ -L../src -lmyapp</pre>
<p>Which now links to the myapp library in addition to the unit tests.</p>
<p>The main.cpp in tests file which could contain the following, if we were to use UnitTest++ as our testing library:</p>
<pre class="brush:c++">#include &lt;unittest++/UnitTest++.h&gt;
#include &lt;myclass.h&gt;

TEST(MyMath) {
    MyClass my;
    CHECK(my.addition(3,4) == 7);
}

int main()
{
    return UnitTest::RunAllTests();
}</pre>
<p>This test will fail because my implementation of MyClass::addition is completely wrong:</p>
<pre class="brush:c++">class MyClass {
public:
    double addition(double a, double b) {
        return a * b;
    }
};</pre>
<p>Note that I&#8217;m including MyClass by through &lt;myclass.h&gt; which is possible because of the INCLUDEPATH variable in defaults.pri.</p>
<p>This is hopefully all you&#8217;ll need to define a project that compiles a library, as well as tests and an application using the library.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes you want to copy some data files to the same folder as your final executable when you are building with qmake in a different directory than your source code. This is what Qt Creator does by default, so this is quite often needed.</p>
<p>Just add the following to your .pro file to copy the folder &#8220;data&#8221; from the source directory to the build directory whenever you build the source code:</p>
<pre>copydata.commands = $(COPY_DIR) $$PWD/data $$OUT_PWD
first.depends = $(first) copydata
export(first.depends)
export(copydata.commands)
QMAKE_EXTRA_TARGETS += first copydata</pre>
<p>The meaning of the different names in the above are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>$(COPY_DIR)</strong> &#8211; Holds a platform-dependent copy-command that makes sure to copy recursively.</li>
<li><strong>$$PWD</strong> &#8211; Holds the name of the source code directory, where your .pro file resides.</li>
<li><strong>$$OUT_PWD</strong> &#8211; Holds the name of the build directory. Note that this may not work if you are running qmake and make in the same directory as your source code, as you will be copying into the same folder as you copy from.</li>
<li><strong>copydata</strong> &#8211; Just a name we choose. You can replace this with whatever you want.</li>
<li><strong>first &#8211;</strong> This is a build step that already exists in the Makefile generated by qmake. We attach the copy build step to this build step.</li>
<li><strong>export</strong> &#8211; Makes the variable in the argument of the function available in a global scope.</li>
<li><strong></strong><strong>QMAKE_EXTRA_TARGETS </strong>&#8211; Tells qmake that you want to build more targets than the ones it adds by default to the Makefile.<strong></strong></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>This method is a bit messy, and I wish the Qt developers would make it easier to do this, but it works. It also ensures that the data is always copied, ensuring that any changes in the data folder are pushed to the build folder.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While Qt3D has a transform for drawing billboards, it is not very useful if you are drawing thousands of particles. This is because the transform can only be applied to one object at the time, and using thousands of objects is never a good idea in neither OpenGL or Qt. This is simply because the overhead of each object is very large, both in terms of memory and performance.</p>
<p>The solution I found was to write my own custom class that inherits QQuickItem3D and is capable of drawing a list of 3D points as billboards by directly turning each sprite towards the camera at every draw call. This is not very efficient, but it works and is way faster than the options: Drawing spheres or creating one billboard per particle. The ideal option is of course to use geometry shaders, but they are not easily available in Qt3D yet. Most likely because its a new feature in OpenGL 3.2.</p>
<p>The class <a href="http://github.com/dragly/multibillboard/">is available on GitHub</a> and the resulting output is shown in this screenshot:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://doc-snapshot.qt-project.org/qt3d-1.0/">Qt3D</a> is an amazing library for Qt that gives you the ability to render your own 3D stuff together with your existing widget or QML based GUI. The library was started by the Qt developers a few years back, but has not yet been released with the official Qt SDK. <a href="http://blog.qt.digia.com/blog/2012/04/11/qt-3d-and-qt5-qt4-news-and-releases/">It was announced</a> that it would be bundled with Qt5.0, but because of the state of the library at the time, its release was postponed. Even so, the library is still very mature and appears to work very well in my opinion. So I would urge you to test it out.</p>
<h2>Simple install on Ubuntu</h2>
<p>To use the library you have a couple of different choices. If you are running Ubuntu, you may just run the following commands:</p>
<pre>sudo apt-get install qt3d5-dev qtdeclarative5-qt3d-plugin</pre>
<p>And you should be good to go. Look for examples in the <a href="http://doc-snapshot.qt-project.org/qt3d-1.0/">Qt3D documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Note that Ubuntu currently doesn&#8217;t have QtQuick.Controls available, so you will have to follow the instructions below to combine Qt3D with QtQuick.Controls.</p>
<h2>Install Qt3D into the newest Qt release</h2>
<p>Currently Qt5.1.1 is the newest stable release of Qt and is the version I&#8217;d recommend that you use with Qt3D.</p>
<ol>
<li>Download and install <a href="http://qt-project.org/downloads">Qt5.1.1</a>.</li>
<li>Clone Qt3D from Gitorious:
<pre>git clone git://gitorious.org/qt/qt3d.git qt3d</pre>
</li>
<li>Open QtCreator from your new Qt installation.</li>
<li>Open the qt3d.pro file from the cloned repository and configure it to use the platforms on which you want to use Qt3D (desktop, Android, etc.).</li>
<li>Build for each platform you want to use. Set the build to Release instead of Debug mode while building. You should receive about one hundred warnings if you are building for Android. As always, ignore these.</li>
<li>Open the build folder in a terminal and run
<pre>make install</pre>
<p>This will not install to your system, but to your Qt installation, so that it gets the ability to do awesome 3D stuff.</li>
</ol>
<p>You should now have Qt3D installed in your Qt installation and be ready to run projects that are using Qt3D.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you reading random stuff on the web while waiting for your C++ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler">compilation</a> to finish? Then you have come to the right place. In this post I will tell you about two really nice tweaks you may do to speed up your compilations, namely ccache and the make -j flag, and how you may set these up in Qt Creator.</p>
<h2>ccache</h2>
<p>ccache is a clever tool that wraps you compiler (g++ or mpicxx) and understands whether the file you are compiling has been compiled before with exactly the same contents and settings. If it has, it just returns a cached result.</p>
<p>Unlike regular make, ccache is extremely good at detecting the true state of what you are compiling. I have never had any trouble with ccache.</p>
<p>This really speeds up the compilation when you are using make clean, especially if you are switching git branches. In other words, it is a much simpler solution to achieve fast compilation with git branches than to create separate build folders for each branch.</p>
<p>To enable ccache, install it with</p>
<pre class="brush:shell">sudo apt-get install ccache</pre>
<p>and add the following to your .pro file:</p>
<pre class="brush:shell">QMAKE_CXX = ccache g++</pre>
<p>Replace g++ with mpicxx if you are using MPI.</p>
<h2>The make -j flag</h2>
<p>I realized when compiling the Qt source that make has a -j flag that enables threaded compilation on all available processors on the machine. This also speeds up compilation significantly, and I made a 3.55x performance gain on a 4 core CPU. To enable this flag, go to the Projects view in Qt Creator and add the following arguments to the make build step:</p>
<pre class="brush:shell">-j</pre>
<p>This should look something like this afterwards:</p>
<div id="attachment_918" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://dragly.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/makej-qtcreator.png" rel="lightbox[414]"><img class="size-large wp-image-918" alt="This is how your project settings should look like after adding the -j option to make." src="http://dragly.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/makej-qtcreator-800x213.png" width="640" height="170" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">This is how your project settings should look like after adding the -j option to make.</p></div>
<p>If you prefer not to use all available processors for compilation, you may add a number after -j to set the number of processors. For instance make -j 3 would compile with 3 processors.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Note</strong>: I&#8217;ve found a better way to visually verify that all tests are running. Check out <a title="Monitoring your unit tests without lifting a finger" href="http://dragly.org/2013/09/13/monitoring-your-unit-tests-without-lifting-a-finger/">this post on Jenkins</a> to see how I&#8217;m now working with my tests. The below post is still useful as a reference on how to set up UnitTest++ in Qt Creator, also when using Jenkins.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Note 2:</strong> <del>A new and, in my opinion, better project structure is shown <a href="http://dragly.org/2014/03/13/new-project-structure-for-projects-in-qt-creator-with-unit-tests">in this new post</a>.</del></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Note 3:</strong> See <a href="http://dragly.org/2015/11/24/getting-started-with-unit-tests-in-qt-creator-with-catch/">this post for the same project structure</a> using the even better Catch testing framework.</em></p>
<p>When you want to make sure that your code is working properly, it is a good idea to divide it into smaller, independent pieces that may be tested individually. A unit test is a short  code that tests a smallest possible portion of your application. It is a good idea to write tests as you go and it can even be useful to write a test before you even implement the function that will be tested.</p>
<p>With the combination of <a href="http://unittest-cpp.sourceforge.net/UnitTest++.html">UnitTest++</a> and <a href="http://qt-project.org/downloads">Qt Creator</a>, I&#8217;m now able to write unit tests while working on the code and also have some nice visual indication about failed tests during the build step of my project:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://dragly.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/qt-creator-unit-tests1.png" rel="lightbox[404]"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-903" src="http://dragly.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/qt-creator-unit-tests1.png" alt="qt-creator-unit-tests1" width="501" height="46" /></a></p>
<p>During my search for a good setup for testing my applications I realized there were a few needs that I wanted to satisfy:</p>
<ol>
<li>Creating new unit tests should be dead-easy to do. I want to spend as little time as possible on reading documentation about the testing framework.</li>
<li>Tests should be run immediately after a new build of the source code, automatically and without the extra hassle to remember to run the tests.</li>
<li>Tests should provide visual feedback with an easy way to get to where the tests fail. This should show up in the IDE or some other useful GUI tool.</li>
<li>The testing framework should be fairly easy to install, especially on Ubuntu. This is because I want to be able to promote it to my fellow students.</li>
</ol>
<p><span id="more-404"></span><br />
For a long time I have been using the QtTestlib. It is fairly quick to use, but I have failed to make the tests give me the visual feedback I wanted. In addition it requires the Qt library to run, which makes it hard to advocate to my fellow students that are not using Qt already.</p>
<h2>UnitTest++</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://unittest-cpp.sourceforge.net/UnitTest++.html">UnitTest++</a> framework is extremely simple to use. To download it in Ubuntu, all you have to do is</p>
<pre class="brush:bash">sudo apt-get install libunittest++-dev</pre>
<p>and create a new C++ file the following way:</p>
<pre class="brush:cpp">#include &lt;unittest++/UnitTest++.h&gt;

TEST(WillFail) {
    CHECK(false);
}

int main()
{
    return UnitTest::RunAllTests();
}</pre>
<p>When you compile, all you need to do is to link to the library. Add the following to your .pro file:</p>
<pre>LIBS += -lunittest++</pre>
<p>You may write as many tests as you like and check that they are successful with the CHECK macro.</p>
<p><a href="http://unittest-cpp.sourceforge.net/UnitTest++.html">Read more about the UnitTest++ library.</a></p>
<h2>The complete solution: UnitTest++ and Qt Creator</h2>
<p>To get the most out UnitTest++ it is a good idea to integrate its output into the Qt Creator IDE. The way I have set this up in Qt Creator is with subprojects. One for the main project, which again is split into the app itself and a library, and one for the tests. In addition, I have a helper project file, named defaults.pri. The structure of the project is like this:</p>
<pre>MyProject
├─ MyProject.pro
├─ defaults.pri
├─ .qmake.conf
├─ src/
│  ├─ src.pro
│  ├─ app/
│  │  ├─ app.pro
│  │  └─ main.cpp
│  └─ libs
│     ├─ libs.pro
│     └─ myclass.cpp
└─ tests/
   ├─ tests.pro
   └─ main.cpp</pre>
<p>The .qmake.conf file is a helper file that defines a few things that we will use in the subprojects. This is only available in Qt5, and looks something like this:</p>
<pre>TOP_PWD=$$PWD
TOP_OUT_PWD=$$shadowed($$PWD)</pre>
<p>The main project file, MyProject.pro will now be based on a subdirs template, and may look like this:</p>
<pre>TEMPLATE=subdirs
SUBDIRS=src tests
CONFIG+=ordered</pre>
<p>The CONFIG+=ordered statement makes sure that the src project is compiled before the tests.</p>
<p>The src.pro file looks similar:</p>
<pre>TEMPLATE=subdirs
SUBDIRS=libs app
CONFIG+=ordered</pre>
<p>The src directory contains the actual project, and is split into app and libs. In app, I now only have a main.cpp file, because the app is basically just something that uses everything in the libs folder. It will depend on the shared compiled library from libs, and app.pro would look something like this:</p>
<pre>include(../../defaults.pri)
TEMPLATE = app
SOURCES = main.cpp</pre>
<p>In the libs folder, I have myclass.cpp, that contains the MyClass class, and is what I want to test. The libs.pro needs to compile to a library, so that it may be used both by app and tests, and could look something like this:</p>
<pre>include(../../defaults.pri)
TEMPLATE = lib
TARGET = myapp
SOURCES = myclass.cpp
HEADERS = myclass.h</pre>
<p>What this class does is not so interesting, it could be anything.</p>
<p>In the tests folder I have simply added a main.cpp file which could contain the following:</p>
<pre>#include &lt;unittest++/UnitTest++.h&gt;
#include &lt;src/myclass.h&gt;

TEST(MyMath) {
    MyClass my;
    CHECK(my.addition(3,4) == 7);
}

int main()
{
    return UnitTest::RunAllTests();
}</pre>
<p>This test will fail because my implementation of MyClass::addition is completely wrong:</p>
<pre>class MyClass {
public:
    double addition(double a, double b) {
        return a * b;
    }
};</pre>
<p>Note that I&#8217;m including MyClass by through &lt;src/myclass.h&gt;. To be allowed to do this, I have included a defaults.pri file that helps me resolve the correct directory of the source files. The defaults.pri file contains this:</p>
<pre># Directories
INCLUDEPATH += $$TOP_PWD/src/libs
SRC_DIR = $$TOP_PWD</pre>
<p>And in the tests.pro file I have:</p>
<pre>include(defaults.pri)
TEMPLATE = app

CONFIG   += console
CONFIG   -= app_bundle
CONFIG   -= qt

SOURCES += main.cpp

LIBS += -lunittest++ -L$$TOP_OUT_PWD/src/libs -lmyapp</pre>
<p>The final two lines will search for any .cpp file in your source directory and add them to your test project. This may be a problem if you have source files hanging around that are not in use by your Qt project, so you may just replace these lines with all your sources explicitly.</p>
<p>If the main program uses some libraries that the test project now will also need, it is very useful to have this common defaults.pri file which may be included in both tests.pro and src.pro.</p>
<h3>Getting that visual output</h3>
<p>With the above, I&#8217;m now able to run the tests executable to get some nice terminal output:</p>
<pre class="brush:bash">../../MyProject/tests/main.cpp:72: warning: Failure in MyMath: my.addition(3,4) == 7
FAILURE: 1 out of 1 tests failed (1 failures).
Test time: 0.00 seconds.</pre>
<p>However, I would like this to show up without having to explicitly run the tests executable. To do this, I have added a Custom Build Step in Qt Creator after the Make step in MyProject.</p>
<p>Do this by selecting Projects &gt; Build Steps &gt; Add Build Step with the following options:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Command:<strong> ./tests/tests</strong><br />
Arguments: <strong>1&gt;&amp;2</strong><br />
Working directory: <strong>%{buildDir}</strong></p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t want the tests to completely fail your build, you may replace the errors with warnings instead by using the following options instead:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Command: <strong>./tests/tests</strong><br />
Arguments:  <strong>| sed s/error:/warning:/ 1&gt;&amp;2</strong><br />
Working directory: <strong>%{buildDir}</strong></p>
<p>It should look something like this:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://dragly.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/qt-creator-build-step.png" rel="lightbox[404]"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-904" src="http://dragly.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/qt-creator-build-step.png" alt="qt-creator-build-step" width="640" height="146" /></a></p>
<p>This will invoke the command line tool sed after running the tests executable to replace all strings with &#8220;error:&#8221; to &#8220;warning:&#8221;. Qt Creator will then just list the failures in the Issues tab and start your application even if the tests fail.</p>
<h3>The best part</h3>
<p>With this up and running, you should get some output like this whenever a test fails:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://dragly.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/qt-creator-unit-tests1.png" rel="lightbox[404]"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-903" src="http://dragly.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/qt-creator-unit-tests1.png" alt="qt-creator-unit-tests1" width="556" height="50" /></a>And the best thing about it is that you can even click the line to go directly to the test that fails. Isn&#8217;t that just great?</p>
<h2>Other frameworks</h2>
<p>I also came across Boost.Test and GoogleTest. The test framework from Boost seemed to be a bit too much hassle to install and the documentation was a bit outdated. It is also said that the code would build slower due to it being a header-only framework.</p>
<p>GoogleTest was likely the best alternative to UnitTest++, but installing it on Ubuntu was a bit more hassle, which made the choice easy. On the other hand, GoogleTest seems to be a more advanced framework, so I may switch sometime in the future.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have grown very fond of the ease and usability of Qt Creator lately, making it my main tool for developing anything in C and C++. Recently I started learning the MPI framework for doing large scale parallel programming and figured I wanted to try to make MPI play along with Qt Creator.</p>
<p>The first thing I noticed is that there is no problem using Qt Creator as an editor while compiling the MPI executable and running it from the command line. However, for the quick and easy testing of minor changes, running by pressing Ctrl + R in Qt Creator quickly came to a high place on my wish list.</p>
<p>After a quick search around the Internet, I found the necessary adjustments to make this exact thing happen. The steps are as follows:</p>
<h3>Make Qt Creator use mpicxx instead of g++</h3>
<p>To change the compiler in Qt Creator, you simply have to edit the .pro file of your project. Add the following lines, and Qt Creator will call mpicxx instead of g++:</p>
<pre class="brush:shell"># MPI Settings
QMAKE_CXX = mpicxx
QMAKE_CXX_RELEASE = $$QMAKE_CXX
QMAKE_CXX_DEBUG = $$QMAKE_CXX
QMAKE_LINK = $$QMAKE_CXX
QMAKE_CC = mpicc

QMAKE_CFLAGS = $$system(mpicc --showme:compile)
QMAKE_LFLAGS = $$system(mpicxx --showme:link)
QMAKE_CXXFLAGS = $$system(mpicxx --showme:compile) -DMPICH_IGNORE_CXX_SEEK
QMAKE_CXXFLAGS_RELEASE = $$QMAKE_CXXFLAGS</pre>
<p>This also sets the correct compile and link flags in addition to changing the linker to mpicxx as well. The DMPICH_IGNORE_CXX_SEEK flag is added to avoid some errors I experienced on Red Hat Linux 5.</p>
<h3>Running the application with mpirun</h3>
<p>Usually Qt Creator will simply run the generated executable after compiling, but to make use of multiple processors (which kind of is the whole point with MPI), you have to change the run settings of your project to a custom executable. This is done in the project configuration in Qt Creator under the Run tab for your project.</p>
<p>Add a Custom Executable run configuration and set the executable to /usr/bin/mpirun or any other path where mpirun resides on your system (run ‘which mpirun’ in a terminal to find it if you don’t know where it is). Then, set the arguments to</p>
<pre class="brush:shell">-n 2 yourexecutable</pre>
<p>to run yourexecutable with 2 processors. Of course you’ll have to change <em>yourexecutable</em> to whatever your executable is named.</p>
<h3>Adding a GUI to your MPI program</h3>
<p>I advice you to not use MPI together with Qt GUI libraries. The reasons for this is that Qt has its own threading classes that are easier to use together with GUI elements in your application if you need them and the fact that if you want to run your app on any large scale cluster you might not be able to use Qt at all, depending on what packages are available on this cluster. A much better solution is to load config settings from a file in the INI format, using for instance the lightweight <a href="http://code.google.com/p/inih/">inih</a> library and make this settings file writable from a Qt GUI application using QSettings to write this file.</p>
<p>The downside of this approach is that you won’t be able to implement any communication directly with the MPI process, but this could be worked around by for instance reading and writing to a progress status file if this is what you need.</p>
<p>However, it is not impossible to make Qt GUI applications play along with MPI, even though you might have to juggle a bit around with stuff to make it work flawlessly. Passing MPI broadcasts and such to all the other processes is definitely possible, and a relatively small example of how to do this is shown in <a href="http://www.velvet-star.com/qt/">this post</a> by Tiffany Chong and Valencia Hare.</p>
