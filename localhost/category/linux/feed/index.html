				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://doc-snapshot.qt-project.org/qt3d-1.0/">Qt3D</a> is an amazing library for Qt that gives you the ability to render your own 3D stuff together with your existing widget or QML based GUI. The library was started by the Qt developers a few years back, but has not yet been released with the official Qt SDK. <a href="http://blog.qt.digia.com/blog/2012/04/11/qt-3d-and-qt5-qt4-news-and-releases/">It was announced</a> that it would be bundled with Qt5.0, but because of the state of the library at the time, its release was postponed. Even so, the library is still very mature and appears to work very well in my opinion. So I would urge you to test it out.</p>
<h2>Simple install on Ubuntu</h2>
<p>To use the library you have a couple of different choices. If you are running Ubuntu, you may just run the following commands:</p>
<pre>sudo apt-get install qt3d5-dev qtdeclarative5-qt3d-plugin</pre>
<p>And you should be good to go. Look for examples in the <a href="http://doc-snapshot.qt-project.org/qt3d-1.0/">Qt3D documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Note that Ubuntu currently doesn&#8217;t have QtQuick.Controls available, so you will have to follow the instructions below to combine Qt3D with QtQuick.Controls.</p>
<h2>Install Qt3D into the newest Qt release</h2>
<p>Currently Qt5.1.1 is the newest stable release of Qt and is the version I&#8217;d recommend that you use with Qt3D.</p>
<ol>
<li>Download and installÂ <a href="http://qt-project.org/downloads">Qt5.1.1</a>.</li>
<li>Clone Qt3D from Gitorious:
<pre>git clone git://gitorious.org/qt/qt3d.git qt3d</pre>
</li>
<li>Open QtCreator from your new Qt installation.</li>
<li>Open the qt3d.pro file from the cloned repository and configure it to use the platforms on which you want to use Qt3D (desktop, Android, etc.).</li>
<li>Build for each platform you want to use. Set the build to Release instead of Debug mode while building. You should receive about one hundred warnings if you are building for Android. As always, ignore these.</li>
<li>Open the build folder in a terminal and run
<pre>make install</pre>
<p>This will not install to your system, but to your Qt installation, so that it gets the ability to do awesome 3D stuff.</li>
</ol>
<p>You should now have Qt3D installed in your Qt installation and be ready to run projects that are using Qt3D.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I love unit testing. First of all, I think it is a good idea to test separate units of the code, but after doing so for some time, I&#8217;ve come to realize that unit tests are great for managing the software development cycle too. It all boils down to the idea that you should write tests before you write your code.</p>
<p>Now, this is something that I and others apparently struggle a lot with. How do you write a test for some code that doesn&#8217;t even exist yet? Even worse, how do you write a test for a piece of software that you&#8217;re not yet sure how will be used?</p>
<p>In computational physics, this problem arises often because we are writing code at the same time as we are trying to understand the physics, mathematics and algorithms at hand. And this is a good thing. You might want to think that one should structure all code before it is written, but this is generally a bad approach in computational physics. Especially if you&#8217;re working on something new. The reason is that you will often understand the problem and algorithms better while developing, rather than just reading about them and trying to analyze them blindly.</p>
<h2>Keeping the tests and code healthy</h2>
<p>But enough with the talk, let&#8217;s just assume that you are convinced that you should (or have to) implement some unit tests. At one point you are likely to be in a position where you find it tiresome to have to go into that folder where the tests are defined and run them manually. This is where Jenkins comes in to play.</p>
<p><span id="more-465"></span></p>
<p>Jenkins is a build bot that is designed to fetch your code from wherever, download, build and run the commands you need to test your code. It also provides a very nice web interface that will allow you to keep track of which builds are working and which are not.</p>
<p><a href="http://dragly.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/jenkins.png" rel="lightbox[465]"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-947" alt="jenkins" src="http://dragly.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/jenkins-e1379054595973-800x280.png" width="640" height="224" /></a>After running tests manually for way too long, this is exactly what I needed. I have already written a post about how you can <a title="Setting up UnitTest++ with Qt Creator" href="http://dragly.org/2013/04/19/setting-up-unittest-with-qt-creator/">launch your tests after building your project in Qt Creator</a>, but this has the disadvantage that your code will be compiled twice whenever you build it, and you&#8217;ll have to wait for the tests to finish before actually seeing your code run. With Jenkins, everything happens in the background. And Jenkins can be configured to run builds periodically, whenever your source code changes or is pushed to Git.</p>
<h2>Setting up Jenkins with access to Git and local folders on Ubuntu</h2>
<p>Installing Jenkins on Ubuntu is a piece of cake:</p>
<pre>sudo apt-get install jenkins</pre>
<p>However, you might want Jenkins to be able to pull your source code and build it from a remote Git repository, or even more obvious, access your projects on your local drive, which it is not able to do by default(!).</p>
<h3>Installing the Git plugin</h3>
<p>After installing Jenkins, you should immediately be able to access it through this page:</p>
<p><a href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a></p>
<p>To install the Git plugin, go to <em>Manage Jenkins</em> â <em>Manage plugins</em> â <em>Available</em> and search for &#8220;git&#8221;. You should install the plugin named <a href="http://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Git+Plugin">Jenkins GIT plugin</a>. If you click this link, you should see the same page as you do if you click the link in the list.</p>
<p>Note that on Ubuntu 13.10 you will also have to install the Mailer plugin. This is a dependency of the Git plugin, but it is currently not listed, so you will have to install it manually for now.</p>
<h3>Optional: Allowing Jenkins access to your private Github repository</h3>
<p>This step is optional. If you only want to use Jenkins for public repositories, you may skip this step.</p>
<p>Jenkins needs its own SSH key to access private Github repositories. If you&#8217;re not familiar with SSH keys and Github, this is a good time to <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys">read a bit about it</a>.</p>
<p>To generate this key, we&#8217;ll log in to the jenkins user in your Ubuntu terminal:</p>
<pre>sudo su jenkins</pre>
<p>Then run</p>
<pre>ssh-keygen</pre>
<p>and go through the steps to generate your key. Then print your key to screen so you may copy and paste it to Github:</p>
<pre>cat /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</pre>
<p>Copy and paste the key to Github. Then, by still being logged in as jenkins, run the following command to verify Github as a proper SSH host:</p>
<pre>ssh git@github.com</pre>
<p>You should receive a prompt like this:</p>
<pre>PTY allocation request failed on channel 0
Hi dragly! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
Connection to github.com closed.</pre>
<p>Now log out of jenkins by clicking CTRL+D.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it! Jenkins now should have access both to public and private repositories.</p>
<h3>Optional: Allowing Jenkins access to your files</h3>
<p>This step is optional. If you only want to use Jenkins for Git projects, you may skip this step.</p>
<p>By default, and this is for security reasons, Jenkins doesn&#8217;t have access to your files on your computer. So if you want to launch a set of unit tests in your home folder, you will need to give Jenkins access to these. The easiest way to do this is by adding the jenkins user to your group. Just replace your_user_name below:</p>
<pre>usermod -G your_user_name jenkins</pre>
<p>Jenkins will now be able to access your files.</p>
<h3>Optional: Adding some extra security by setting up a firewall</h3>
<p>Jenkins uses port 8080 on your computer and by default allows anyone to access its services through this port. While you may mess around with Jenkins&#8217; settings to set up user authentication, I found it better just to enable a firewall in Ubuntu and restrict inbound access on all ports (except the ones I use for other things).</p>
<p>Download and install <em>Firewall Configuration</em> from Ubuntu Software Center. And turn it on like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://dragly.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/firewall.png" rel="lightbox[465]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948" alt="firewall" src="http://dragly.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/firewall-e1379055216219.png" width="361" height="174" /></a>Now your Jenkins bot won&#8217;t allow anyone else access to run jobs on your machine.</p>
<h2>Setting up your first project</h2>
<p>Click <em>Jenkins</em> â <em>New job</em> and give it a name of your choice. Select <b>Build a free-style software project</b> as your setting and click OK.</p>
<p><a href="http://dragly.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/newjob.png" rel="lightbox[465]"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-949" alt="newjob" src="http://dragly.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/newjob-e1379055794391-800x235.png" width="640" height="188" /></a>In the next window, select Git as the <em>Source Code Management</em> option and enter your repository URL with http as the access method. If it is a private repository, follow the steps above to give Jenkins access to it, and use SSH as your access method.</p>
<p><a href="http://dragly.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/jenkins-git.png" rel="lightbox[465]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-953" alt="jenkins-git" src="http://dragly.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/jenkins-git.png" width="565" height="184" /></a></p>
<p>Further down, add an <em>Execute shell</em> build step:</p>
<p><a href="http://dragly.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/build-step.png" rel="lightbox[465]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954" alt="build-step" src="http://dragly.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/build-step.png" width="548" height="125" /></a></p>
<p>This allows you to type in whatever commands are needed to run before the build may be tested. In my case, it would be to do something like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://dragly.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/execute-shell2.png" rel="lightbox[465]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958" alt="execute-shell" src="http://dragly.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/execute-shell2.png" width="516" height="259" /></a>After doing so, click <em>Apply</em> and test your build by clicking <em>Build now</em>.</p>
<h3>Checking the output</h3>
<p>What Jenkins does now is to clone your repository into a temporary folder and execute the commands given in the <em>Execute shell </em>text box. You may check the result by looking at the <em>Build History</em> on the left hand side of the screen. Blue means unstable (crashed) build, red means stable build. Hover the pointer over a build and click <em>Console output</em> to see the exact output of the build. This is very useful if the build should fail and you want to know why.</p>
<p><a href="http://dragly.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/build-history.png" rel="lightbox[465]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959" alt="build-history" src="http://dragly.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/build-history.png" width="215" height="114" /></a>If all goes well, you may explore the options to build whenever your source code changes or periodically, by looking at the <em>Build triggers</em>.</p>
<p>There are also plenty of other features in Jenkins, but I&#8217;ll leave it up to you to explore them all. The last thing you should do before you stop playing around is to add Jenkins as your browser&#8217;s start up page and always keep it visible on a screen so that you at any given time know how your builds perform.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Note</strong>: I&#8217;ve found a better way to visually verify that all tests are running. Check out <a title="Monitoring your unit tests without lifting a finger" href="http://dragly.org/2013/09/13/monitoring-your-unit-tests-without-lifting-a-finger/">this post on Jenkins</a> to see how I&#8217;m now working with my tests. The below post is still useful as a reference on how to set up UnitTest++ in Qt Creator, also when using Jenkins.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Note 2:</strong> <del>A new and, in my opinion, better project structure is shown <a href="http://dragly.org/2014/03/13/new-project-structure-for-projects-in-qt-creator-with-unit-tests">in this new post</a>.</del></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Note 3:</strong> See <a href="http://dragly.org/2015/11/24/getting-started-with-unit-tests-in-qt-creator-with-catch/">this post for the same project structure</a> using the even better Catch testing framework.</em></p>
<p>When you want to make sure that your code is working properly, it is a good idea to divide it into smaller, independent pieces that may be tested individually. A unit test is a shortÂ  code that tests a smallest possible portion of your application. It is a good idea to write tests as you go and it can even be useful to write a test before you even implement the function that will be tested.</p>
<p>With the combination of <a href="http://unittest-cpp.sourceforge.net/UnitTest++.html">UnitTest++</a> and <a href="http://qt-project.org/downloads">Qt Creator</a>, I&#8217;m now able to write unit tests while working on the code and also have some nice visual indication about failed tests during the build step of my project:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://dragly.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/qt-creator-unit-tests1.png" rel="lightbox[404]"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-903" src="http://dragly.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/qt-creator-unit-tests1.png" alt="qt-creator-unit-tests1" width="501" height="46" /></a></p>
<p>During my search for a good setup for testing my applications I realized there were a few needs that I wanted to satisfy:</p>
<ol>
<li>Creating new unit tests should be dead-easy to do. I want to spend as little time as possible on reading documentation about the testing framework.</li>
<li>Tests should be run immediately after a new build of the source code, automatically and without the extra hassle to remember to run the tests.</li>
<li>Tests should provide visual feedback with an easy way to get to where the tests fail. This should show up in the IDE or some other useful GUI tool.</li>
<li>The testing framework should be fairly easy to install, especially on Ubuntu. This is because I want to be able to promote it to my fellow students.</li>
</ol>
<p><span id="more-404"></span><br />
For a long time I have been using the QtTestlib. It is fairly quick to use, but I have failed to make the tests give me the visual feedback I wanted. In addition it requires the Qt library to run, which makes it hard to advocate to my fellow students that are not using Qt already.</p>
<h2>UnitTest++</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://unittest-cpp.sourceforge.net/UnitTest++.html">UnitTest++</a> framework is extremely simple to use. To download it in Ubuntu, all you have to do is</p>
<pre class="brush:bash">sudo apt-get install libunittest++-dev</pre>
<p>and create a new C++ file the following way:</p>
<pre class="brush:cpp">#include &lt;unittest++/UnitTest++.h&gt;

TEST(WillFail) {
Â Â Â  CHECK(false);
}

int main()
{
Â Â Â  return UnitTest::RunAllTests();
}</pre>
<p>When you compile, all you need to do is to link to the library. Add the following to your .pro file:</p>
<pre>LIBS += -lunittest++</pre>
<p>You may write as many tests as you like and check that they are successful with the CHECK macro.</p>
<p><a href="http://unittest-cpp.sourceforge.net/UnitTest++.html">Read more about the UnitTest++ library.</a></p>
<h2>The complete solution: UnitTest++ and Qt Creator</h2>
<p>To get the most out UnitTest++ it is a good idea to integrate its output into the Qt Creator IDE. The way I have set this up in Qt Creator is with subprojects. One for the main project, which again is split into the app itself and a library, and one for the tests. In addition, I have a helper project file, named defaults.pri. The structure of the project is like this:</p>
<pre>MyProject
ââ MyProject.pro
ââ defaults.pri
ââ .qmake.conf
ââ src/
âÂ  ââ src.pro
âÂ  ââ app/
âÂ  âÂ  ââ app.pro
âÂ  âÂ  ââ main.cpp
âÂ  ââ libs
âÂ Â Â Â  ââ libs.pro
âÂ Â Â Â  ââ myclass.cpp
ââ tests/
Â Â  ââ tests.pro
Â Â  ââ main.cpp</pre>
<p>The .qmake.conf file is a helper file that defines a few things that we will use in the subprojects. This is only available in Qt5, and looks something like this:</p>
<pre>TOP_PWD=$$PWD
TOP_OUT_PWD=$$shadowed($$PWD)</pre>
<p>The main project file, MyProject.pro will now be based on a subdirs template, and may look like this:</p>
<pre>TEMPLATE=subdirs
SUBDIRS=src tests
CONFIG+=ordered</pre>
<p>The CONFIG+=ordered statement makes sure that the src project is compiled before the tests.</p>
<p>The src.pro file looks similar:</p>
<pre>TEMPLATE=subdirs
SUBDIRS=libs app
CONFIG+=ordered</pre>
<p>The src directory contains the actual project, and is split into app and libs. In app, I now only have a main.cpp file, because the app is basically just something that uses everything in the libs folder. It will depend on the shared compiled library from libs, and app.pro would look something like this:</p>
<pre>include(../../defaults.pri)
TEMPLATE = app
SOURCES = main.cpp</pre>
<p>In the libs folder, I have myclass.cpp, that contains the MyClass class, and is what I want to test. The libs.pro needs to compile to a library, so that it may be used both by app and tests, and could look something like this:</p>
<pre>include(../../defaults.pri)
TEMPLATE = lib
TARGET = myapp
SOURCES = myclass.cpp
HEADERS = myclass.h</pre>
<p>What this class does is not so interesting, it could be anything.</p>
<p>In the tests folder I have simply added a main.cpp file which could contain the following:</p>
<pre>#include &lt;unittest++/UnitTest++.h&gt;
#include &lt;src/myclass.h&gt;

TEST(MyMath) {
Â Â Â  MyClass my;
Â Â Â  CHECK(my.addition(3,4) == 7);
}

int main()
{
Â Â Â  return UnitTest::RunAllTests();
}</pre>
<p>This test will fail because my implementation of MyClass::addition is completely wrong:</p>
<pre>class MyClass {
public:
Â Â Â  double addition(double a, double b) {
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  return a * b;
Â Â Â  }
};</pre>
<p>Note that I&#8217;m including MyClass by through &lt;src/myclass.h&gt;. To be allowed to do this, I have included a defaults.pri file that helps me resolve the correct directory of the source files. The defaults.pri file contains this:</p>
<pre># Directories
INCLUDEPATH += $$TOP_PWD/src/libs
SRC_DIR = $$TOP_PWD</pre>
<p>And in the tests.pro file I have:</p>
<pre>include(defaults.pri)
TEMPLATE = app

CONFIGÂ Â  += console
CONFIGÂ Â  -= app_bundle
CONFIGÂ Â  -= qt

SOURCES += main.cpp

LIBS += -lunittest++ -L$$TOP_OUT_PWD/src/libs -lmyapp</pre>
<p>The final two lines will search for any .cpp file in your source directory and add them to your test project. This may be a problem if you have source files hanging around that are not in use by your Qt project, so you may just replace these lines with all your sources explicitly.</p>
<p>If the main program uses some libraries that the test project now will also need, it is very useful to have this common defaults.pri file which may be included in both tests.pro and src.pro.</p>
<h3>Getting that visual output</h3>
<p>With the above, I&#8217;m now able to run the tests executable to get some nice terminal output:</p>
<pre class="brush:bash">../../MyProject/tests/main.cpp:72: warning: Failure in MyMath: my.addition(3,4) == 7
FAILURE: 1 out of 1 tests failed (1 failures).
Test time: 0.00 seconds.</pre>
<p>However, I would like this to show up without having to explicitly run the tests executable. To do this, I have added a Custom Build Step in Qt Creator after the Make step in MyProject.</p>
<p>Do this by selecting Projects &gt; Build Steps &gt; Add Build Step with the following options:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Command:<strong> ./tests/tests</strong><br />
Arguments: <strong>1&gt;&amp;2</strong><br />
Working directory: <strong>%{buildDir}</strong></p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t want the tests to completely fail your build, you may replace the errors with warnings instead by using the following options instead:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Command: <strong>./tests/tests</strong><br />
Arguments: Â <strong>| sed s/error:/warning:/ 1&gt;&amp;2</strong><br />
Working directory: <strong>%{buildDir}</strong></p>
<p>It should look something like this:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://dragly.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/qt-creator-build-step.png" rel="lightbox[404]"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-904" src="http://dragly.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/qt-creator-build-step.png" alt="qt-creator-build-step" width="640" height="146" /></a></p>
<p>This will invoke the command line tool sed after running the tests executable to replace all strings with &#8220;error:&#8221; to &#8220;warning:&#8221;. Qt Creator will then just list the failures in the Issues tab and start your application even if the tests fail.</p>
<h3>The best part</h3>
<p>With this up and running, you should get some output like this whenever a test fails:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://dragly.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/qt-creator-unit-tests1.png" rel="lightbox[404]"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-903" src="http://dragly.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/qt-creator-unit-tests1.png" alt="qt-creator-unit-tests1" width="556" height="50" /></a>And the best thing about it is that you can even click the line to go directly to the test that fails. Isn&#8217;t that just great?</p>
<h2>Other frameworks</h2>
<p>I also came across Boost.Test and GoogleTest. The test framework from Boost seemed to be a bit too much hassle to install and the documentation was a bit outdated. It is also said that the code would build slower due to it being a header-only framework.</p>
<p>GoogleTest was likely the best alternative to UnitTest++, but installing it on Ubuntu was a bit more hassle, which made the choice easy. On the other hand, GoogleTest seems to be a more advanced framework, so I may switch sometime in the future.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ovito is a great tool to visualize atoms from molecular dynamics simulations and to perform some statistical analysis on the data. The tool is an alternative to other similar tools such as VMD and ParaView.</p>
<p>The current version of Ovito in the Ubuntu repositories (version 0.9.2) is sadly very outdated. Even though you of course may download the latest version from Ovito&#8217;s webpages and install it locally in your home folder, I often find it better to get a newer package version.</p>
<p>At the Computational Physics group&#8217;s PPA I have now uploaded the latest build of Ovito for Ubuntu in a package that will automatically replace the current Ovito version. Note that this is not a release version of Ovito, but the latest version fetched from Ovito&#8217;s sources (currently nicknamed 1.1.1.90). The reason is that Ovito&#8217;s creator, Alexander Stukowski, was kind enough to implement a suggestion we proposed to change the default input handler for the viewports to be the orbit input handler. This behavior feels so much more natural and makes the already great Ovito application even better.</p>
<p>To install the latest version of Ovito, all you need to do is to open up a terminal and type these lines:</p>
<pre class="brush:shell">sudo apt-add-repository ppa:comp-phys/stable
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ovito</pre>
<p>Note that the Computational Physics repository also contains newer versions of the Armadillo package, which will automatically be updated if you do not remove the repository after installing Ovito.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today I found a great tool to ease the navigation in terminal, called apparix. It lets you bookmark a folder so that you easily can navigate to it just by typing</p>
<pre class="brush:shell">to nameofbookmark</pre>
<p>To install apparix in Ubuntu, type</p>
<pre class="brush:shell">sudo apt-get install apparix</pre>
<p>in a terminal window.</p>
<p>After installation you need to set up the aliases âbmâ for bookmarking and âtoâ for going to a bookmark by adding a few functions to your .bashrc file in your home folder (if you donât have this file, you can create it yourself).</p>
<p>Youâll find the functions you need to add by issuing the command</p>
<pre class="brush:shell">apparix --shell-examples</pre>
<p>in a terminal window. Copy everything below âBash-style functionsâ except the âCSH-style aliasesâ. Paste this into your .bashrc file.</p>
<p>Open up a new terminal, cd to your directory of choice and type</p>
<pre class="brush:shell">bm mybookmark</pre>
<p>to bookmark the folder. Afterwards you can go to any folder and type</p>
<pre class="brush:shell">to mybookmark</pre>
<p>to go to your bookmark.</p>
<p>This tool is of course available for other Linux distributions too.</p>
